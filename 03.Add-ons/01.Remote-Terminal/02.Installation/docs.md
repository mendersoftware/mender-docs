Remote Terminal add-on installation is covered in the following sections:
* [mender-convert integration](../../../04.System-updates-Debian-family/99.Variables/docs.md) for installation in the existing images
* [Yocto projects](../../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project/05.Customize-Mender/docs.md) for the installation in the Yocto environment
* [installation with a deb](../../../09.Downloads/docs.md#Install-the-remote-terminal-client) for the installation from the Debian package

Apart from [configuration](../06.Mender-shell-configuration-file/docs.md), you do not need any other special steps
to get the Remote Terminal add-on up and running.
