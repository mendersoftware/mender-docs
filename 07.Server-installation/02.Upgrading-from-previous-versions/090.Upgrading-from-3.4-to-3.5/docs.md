title: Upgrading from 3.4 to 3.5
taxonomy:
    category: docs

---

This is a tutorial for upgrading the Mender Server to version 3.5 in production environments.
With the 3.5 we introduced a new element at the heart of ths system:
the so-called _reporting_ service, which came with [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/).
This brings an additional upgrade complication, and needs some attention.

Besides the version specific guidelines below, please make sure you're following
the [suggested upgrade best practices](../docs.md) to reduce the risk
of unpredictable downtime and data loss.

## Before you start

### Enough disc space

Be sure to have at least `6%` free disc space, on the volume where `OpenSearch` runs.
The _disc threshold monitor_ will check this value, and in case there is more than `95%`
space used it will report errors:

```shell
[2023-02-20T16:23:14,185][WARN ][o.o.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor] [4c17a7eaeccf] flood stage disk watermark [95%] exceeded on [HFJTQ-0vT0iXlgR7_n9Tuw][4c17a7eaeccf][/usr/share/opensearch/data/nodes/0] free: 21.6gb[4.8%], all indices on this node will be marked read-only
```

Where we assume the default settings. It will manifest itself with the UI reporting errors like:

```
undefined devices couldn't be loaded. Request failed with status code 503
```

### vm.max_map_count

Be sure that you possess enough `vm.max_map_count`. You need at least `262144`, and you can
change it via:

```shell
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

Lack in the above can result in the following log line from opensearch:

```shell
[1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]
ERROR: OpenSearch did not exit normally - check the logs at /usr/share/opensearch/logs/opensearch-cluster.log
```

If that happens, free some space and restart your setup.

## Run 3.5

Once ready, you can start the new version, and as soon as the services are healthy
and alive you can proceed to the next step: propagation of devices and deployments.

### Propagate devices

For convenience, we provide a command line tool to perform the re-indexing of all your devices.
The following table presents example usage:

!!! For non enterprise deployments please replace `deviceauth-enterprise` with `deviceauth`

### Propagate deployments

You have to migrate deployments, in a similar way to devices, using the following command line
tool:

!!! For non enterprise deployments please replace `deployments-enterprise` with `deployments`

## Troubleshooting

### Environment variables

We enable the reporting service in three places: deployments, gui, deviceauth.
In case you run into problems, you can check the following:

* deployments service `DEPLOYMENTS_REPORTING_ADDR` environment variable.
 It should be similar to the default: `http://mender-reporting:8080`
* gui setting `HAVE_REPORTING=1` should be set to `1`, unless you explicitly
 want it otherwise.
* deviceauth `DEVICEAUTH_ENABLE_REPORTING=1` environment variable 
 should be set to `1`, unless you explicitly want it otherwise.

### Required components

With 3.5 we brought two additional components, which result in three
new items in the Mender stack: two for reporting, and one for opensearch.

You should see the following up and running:
