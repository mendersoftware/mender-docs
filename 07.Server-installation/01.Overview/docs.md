Mender backend is composed of a number of microservices, each implementing a
small, well defined piece of functionality.

The integration environment brings together the following services:

- [Mender Device Authentication Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deviceauth?target=_blank)
- [Mender Device Configuration Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deviceconfig?target=_blank)
- [Mender Device Connect Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deviceconnect?target=_blank)
- [Mender Deployments Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deployments?target=_blank)
- [Mender Device Inventory Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/inventory?target=_blank)
- [Mender User Administration Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/useradm?target=_blank)
- [Mender Workflows Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/workflows?target=_blank)
- [Mender Create Artifact Worker](https://github.com/mendersoftware/create-artifact-worker?target=_blank)
- API Gateway based on [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/?target=_blank)
- [Minio](https://www.minio.io?target=_blank) object storage
- [NATS.io](https://nats.io?target=_blank) messaging system

Services are delivered in form of Docker images, available from
official [Mender Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mendersoftware/?target=_blank).
When required, each service can be built directly from its source code. Consult
respective repositories for build instructions.

While it is possible to `docker pull` individual images and start containers
manually,
the [integration repository](https://github.com/mendersoftware/integration?target=_blank)
provides a convenient setup based on Docker Compose tool. The
`docker-compose.yml` file describes the following setup:
