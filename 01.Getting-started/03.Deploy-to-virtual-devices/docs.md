In this tutorial we will show how to use the intuitive Mender server UI
to deploy a full rootfs image update to a virtual device which is
connected to the server. The virtual device is bundled with the
Mender server to make it easy to test Mender.


## Prerequisites

The test environment should be set up and working successfully
as described in [Create a test environment](../Create-a-test-environment).


## Authorize the device

Open the Mender UI in the same browser as you accepted the certificate
in as part of [Create a test environment](../Create-a-test-environment).
It is available at [https://localhost:8080/](https://localhost:8080/?target=_blank).

There should be a virtual device that is waiting authorization.
This means that the Mender client, which runs as a daemon on the device,
is asking to join the Mender server so that the server can manage
its deployments. You can also see these requests
in the server access logs in the terminal where you started the
Mender server.

You can review the device before authorizing it to join the server.
When you are ready, simply click the **Authorize** button
in the **Devices** tab.

! There are security implications to connecting a client and server for the first time, also known as *bootstrapping*. If a client and server have not exchanged any information in advance, they need to accept each other on trust this first time, with the risk that the information the other party presents is spoofed. To mitigate this risk, the Mender client preinstalls the TLS certificate of the server when it is provisioned, as part of the Yocto Project image build. So it is not possible for a rogue server to intercept the connection from a client or pretend to be a different server, assuming server's private TLS key is securely managed. A rogue device can still spoof the information it sends to the server in order to be authorized, and this is why Mender asks you to make the authorization decision. However, the risk of letting the server manage a rogue device is much lower than the risk of a rogue server managing devices.


## See information about the device

Mender automatically collects identity and inventory information
about the connected devices. You can view this information by
clicking on a device. It should look similar to the following:

![Mender UI - Device information](device_information.png)


!!! Which information is collected about devices is fully configurable; see the documentation on [Identity](../../Client-configuration/Identity) and [Inventory](../../Client-configuration/Inventory) for more information.

You can also see that the `image_id` starts with `core-image-full-cmdline`.
The device console can be shown by running the following command:

```
sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps | grep mender-client | cut -f1 -d' ')
```

It should yield output similar to the following:

> ...  
> [  OK  ] Started Network Name Resolution.  
> [  OK  ] Started Mender OTA update service.  
> [  OK  ] Reached target Multi-User System.  
>  
> Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 2.1.1 vexpress-qemu ttyAMA0

After deploying the update below, you can verify that this `image_id` and the console text (from `/etc/issue`) has changed.


## Upload a new rootfs image to the server

Before we can deploy a new image to devices, it needs
to be uploaded to the server. Any rootfs image that
includes Mender support can be used, as described in
[Building a Mender Yocto Project image](../../Artifacts/Building-Mender-Yocto-image).

To make testing easier, a demo image that can be used with
the virtual device is provided for download at
[https://d1b0l86ne08fsf.cloudfront.net/latest/demo/vexpress-qemu/core-image-full-cmdline-vexpress-qemu.ext4](https://d1b0l86ne08fsf.cloudfront.net/latest/demo/vexpress-qemu/core-image-full-cmdline-vexpress-qemu.ext4).

After the download finishes, go back to the Mender server UI,
click the **Software** tab and upload this image.

!!! Currently there are quite a few fields to fill out, but this will very soon be simplified to just *Name* and *Description*, the rest being auto-detected.

Please fill in the following:

* Name: `release2`
* Yocto ID: `test`
* Checksum: `test`
* Device type compatibility: `vexpress-qemu`
* Description: `My test build`

In the UI, it should look something like this:

![Mender UI - Upload image](upload_image.png)

! Thorough validation of image metadata is not yet implemented, so we recommend using the exact values above to avoid any issues.

!!! Mender keeps track of which *Device type* an image supports as part of the metadata of an image. In addition, a device reports which Device type it is as part of its inventory information. During a deployment, the Mender server makes sure that a device will only get a image it supports. This increases the robustness of Mender as it avoids situations like deploying images that are not supported by the device hardware.


## Deploy the rootfs image to the device

Now that we have the device connected and the image
uploaded to the server, all that remains is to go to the
**Deployments** tab and click **Create a deployment**.

You will be asked which image to deploy and which
group of devices to deploy it to. Since we have just
one image and no custom groups right now, we simply select
the image we just uploaded and **All devices**, then
**Create deployment**.

!!! It may take a few seconds until the deployment shows up. You can also refresh your browser to see it immediately.


## See the progress of the deployment

As the deployment progresses, you can click on it to view more details about the current status across all devices.
In the example below, we can see that the device is in process of installing the new image.

![Mender UI - Deployment progress](deployment_report.png)

! As the deployment progresses, the UI should auto-refresh periodically. However, if this does not happen or you want to see the current state, you can refresh your browser manually.

!!! The deployment to the virtual device should take about 2-3 minutes to complete and report success or failure.


## Verify the deployment

Once the deployment completes, you should see it in *Past deployments*.
If the deployment fails you can view the deployment log,
which is obtained from the device, to diagnose the issue.
You can also see the state of deployments on the Dashboard.
In **Devices** you can see that `image_id` has now changed to `test`.

Furthermore, you can again check the terminal of the virtual device with:

```
sudo docker logs $(sudo docker ps | grep mender-client | cut -f1 -d' ')
```

It should yield output similar to the following.

> ...  
> [  OK  ] Started Network Name Resolution.  
> [  OK  ] Started Mender OTA update service.  
> [  OK  ] Reached target Multi-User System.  
>   
> This system has been updated by Mender build...

You can see that this has changed from when we ran it in
[See information about the device](#see-information-about-the-device).
This shows your virtual device runs the new rootfs!


## Deploy another update

For robustness and avoiding unnecessary deployments, Mender
will not deploy an image that is already installed on a device.
Thus, if you create another deployment with the image you already
uploaded, Mender will see that it is the same rootfs image
that is already installed and skip the deployment. It will
immediately be marked as successful and moved to *Past deployments*.

For this reason, we provide another image that you can use
to deploy with at [https://d1b0l86ne08fsf.cloudfront.net/latest/vexpress-qemu/core-image-full-cmdline-vexpress-qemu.ext4](https://d1b0l86ne08fsf.cloudfront.net/latest/vexpress-qemu/core-image-full-cmdline-vexpress-qemu.ext4). 
Make sure to not mix it with the demo rootfs you downloaded above,
as they have the same file name.
This is actually the original rootfs of your
QEMU virtual device, before you deployed the update above.

When you upload this image, it is very important that
you set the right **Yocto ID**. The Yocto ID in this particular
image changes over time with new builds, and you can find it by running the
following long command string:

```
mkdir /tmp/rootfs && sudo mount -t ext4 -o loop core-image-full-cmdline-vexpress-qemu.ext4 /tmp/rootfs/ && cat /tmp/rootfs/etc/mender/build_mender | grep IMAGE_ID | cut -f3 -d" "  && sudo umount /tmp/rootfs && rmdir /tmp/rootfs
```

!!! All this command does is to look at the file `/etc/mender/build_mender` inside the root file system. It contains `IMAGE_ID` which is mapped to `Yocto ID` (both will soon be renamed to Image ID).

The output should look something like `core-image-full-cmdline-20161006122803`.

After finding the correct value for Yocto ID, go
to **Software** again and upload with the following fields:

* Name: `release1`
* Yocto ID: `core-image-full-cmdline-20161006122803` (**NB! use the string you found above**)
* Checksum: `test`
* Device type compatibility: `vexpress-qemu`
* Description: `My original build`

After the rootfs has been uploaded, you can deploy it to your device
to get it back to the original root file system.

Now, if you observe the virtual client boot process
in your docker compose terminal, you can see the original message
from `/etc/issue` just before the login prompt again:

> mender-client_1             | Poky (Yocto Project Reference Distro) 2.1.1 vexpress-qemu ttyAMA0

Following this, you can deploy the `release2` rootfs again, and so forth.


## Deploy to custom groups

As you might have noticed, it is possible to create
groups in the **Devices** tab. Once you have created a
group and added one or more devices to it, you can deploy
an image to that group by selecting the group instead
of *All devices* when you create a deployment.

This can be very useful in order to deploy to test devices
before production, or only deploy to devices owned by a specific customer.

! To avoid accidents, Mender only allows **a device to be in one group at the time**. If a device could be in several groups, for example test *and* production, unintended deployments and downtime could occur. Therefore, as a safety measure, Mender does not allow this.


## Deploy to physical devices

**Congratulations!** You have used the Mender server to deploy your first managed update!
If you have a BeagleBone Black, you can proceed to
[Deploy to physical devices](../Deploy-to-physical-devices) to try out deploying to a
real-world device!
