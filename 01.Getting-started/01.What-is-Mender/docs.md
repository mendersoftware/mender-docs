The aim of the project is to help secure connected devices by providing a **safe** and **reliable** software update process.

As an open source project we welcome contributions. Find out more about how to contribute at [mender.io/open-source](https://mender.io/open-source?target=_blank).


## What problem does Mender solve?

One of the challenges surrounding connected devices and the Internet of Things is that devices are now further from your control. Manual, physical updates are difficult when your devices are distributed over a wide area, or in hard-to-reach locations.

You want your devices to be secure and healthy. It is critical that devices are kept up and running on the latest versions of software where vulnerabilities and bugs have been patched. Remote updates allow you to get patches and new features out to your devices more quickly.

You will also want to make sure that the update process goes smoothly, and any failures or interruptions will not cause your device to be 'bricked' or unreachable. It is important to roll back to the previous working version should anything go wrong during updates.

Remote updates also require a means of secure communication with each device.
