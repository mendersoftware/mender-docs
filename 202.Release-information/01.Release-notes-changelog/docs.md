### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (dunfell-v2020.07)

New changes in meta-mender since zeus-v2020.06:

* uboot_auto_configure: build U-Boot the same way Yocto does
* Fix error message about `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET` being wrong,
  such as:
  ```
  ERROR: u-boot-fw-utils-mender-auto-provided-1.0-r0 do_configure: U-Boot configuration rpi_4_config has setting:
  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x400000
  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND=0x800000
  but Mender expects:
  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x800000
  Please fix U-Boot’s configuration file.
  ```
* add support for separate A/B kernel partitions
* Add MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS_SIZES_MB variable
* U-Boot auto-configuration: Better algorithm for removing
  options from defconfig files. This increases board compatibility.
* Start using libubootenv for U-Boot environment manipulation.
  This deprecates the u-boot-fw-utils tools, which have been removed
  from upstream. The functionality and command line API is the same.
* `libubootenv` is now used instead of `u-boot-fw-utils`. If
  you have a "fw-utils" type recipe in your layer, you probably need to
  remove it, particularly if it references `u-boot-mender-common.inc`.
* Patch broken UBI support in libubootenv_0.2.
* chmod 600 on mender.conf
  ([MEN-3762](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3762))
* Add mender-2.2.1 and mender-artifact-3.3.1 recipes.
* Add mender-2.3.0 and mender-artifact-3.4.0 recipes.
* Add mender-binary-delta-1.1.0 release.
* Remove mender-client recipes that are incompatible with dunfell.
  ([MEN-3764](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3764))
* Fix incorrect BOOTENV_SIZE value being used in libubootenv
  recipe. The symptom of this was a non-working set of `fw_printenv` and
  `fw_setenv` tools:
  ```
  root@raspberrypi4:~# fw_printenv
  Cannot read environment, using default
  Cannot read default environment from file
  ```
  ([MEN-3834](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3834))
* Fix fsck running on every boot in dunfell.

* The Artifact parser now fails when no 'device-type' is found in a payload.
* Disallow writes of UpdateModule Artifacts with no 'device-type' flag
* Return an error code if CLI read <artifact> fails
* Disallow parsing ArtifactV2 with empty device type field
* Display all CLI commands and flags sorted alplhabetically
* Missing a required CLI flag will now return an error
* Indexed the CLI commands by category
  This should make it easier to distinguish the large number of CLI commands
  depending on their intended usage.
  The two categories added are:
  * Artifact creation and validation
  * Artifact modification
  And should help to roughly set the commands apart depending on if they are
  intended to work with a standard Artifact, either creating it or validating it.
  The second category is intended for modification of already existing artifacts,
  such as adding or removing files, signing or modifying the Artifact name.
* Add(cli): Print the urfave/cli error on error

* mender-part-images: Added handling for extra partitions
* mender-artifact: make it available in SDK
* remove stray '-' in IMAGE_NAME
* Fix failure in boot log when `MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS` is used.
  `mender-growfs-data` and `MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS` are mutually exclusive,
  so set the default of `mender-growfs-data` to off if
  `MENDER_EXTRA_PARTS` is being used.
* Improve warning when multiple DTB files are in KERNEL_DEVICETREE
* In demo mode, put demo certificate in same directory as Debian package.
  ([MEN-3048](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3048))

* Add mender-artifact 3.3.0b1 recipe
* mender: Add signature/secure-boot support.
* Remove mender-artifact 3.1 recipes (EOL).

  This will help when not using `mender-grub`, and instead using
  Barebox, for example.
* Make sure partitions are marked for fsck'ing by default.
* Follow e2fsprogs version bump from 1.44 to 1.45.
* Follow systemd feature rename from time-epoch to set-time-epoch.
* systemd-conf: Fix missing FILES section which is mandatory on zeus.
* Work around missing LSB support in zeus.
  This is a very intrusive change, which creates the `/lib64` symlink on
  the root filesystem for 64-bit systems. This symlink is normally
  missing when building with Yocto, but was provided by the LSB package
  previously. The directory is necessary to remain compatible with
  software built outside of Yocto. The Mender demo artifact, as well as
  the binary delta update module are examples of such components.
  If the link turns out to conflict with another package, it should be
  possible to work around the problem by adding this to the other
  package, either in the original `.bb` file or a `.bbappend` file:
  ```
  RPROVIDES_${PN} += "lsb-ld"
  ```
* Enable CONFIG_EFI_STUB on kernels when booting with UEFI on ARM.
* Add mender 2.2.0 recipe and remove beta
* Add mender-artifact 3.3.0 recipe and remove beta
* Add mender 2.1.3 recipe
* raspberrypi4: update U-Boot patches to apply to 2019.07 version
  ([MEN-3262](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3262))
* Renamed mender -> mender-client
  This renaming was done to conform with the new naming introduced. This helps
  seperate Mender (the product), from Mender-client, which is a part of the
  aforementioned product.
  The renaming is due in parts:
  * The 'mender.service' systemd recipe is now named 'mender-client.service'
  * The bitbake recipes are now renamed from 'mender%.bb' to 'mender-client%.bb'
  * The Mender feature 'mender-install' is now 'mender-client-install'
  * The mender directory holding the mender-client recipe is also renamed 'mender-client'
* Upgrade to U-Boot 2020.01 and GRUB 2.04 to fix Beaglebone support.
* Updated the LIC_FILES_CHECKSUM after removing dependencies
  ([MEN-3251](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3251))
* mender-grub: Dynamically determine mender_grub_storage_device.
* mender-grub: Add regexp module.
* Deprecate MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE variable.
* raspberrypi: add state script to update boot firmware
  Raspberry Pi boards have a set of boot firmware files that are
  located on the vfat boot part, and these files are not updated
  when you perform an update of the root filesystem.
  Occasionally there will be changes to the Raspberry Pi software stack
  that requires that these files are update. Typically there is something
  in the Linux kernel that requires something that is in the boot
  firmware. This means that to update the Linux kernel you must also
  update the boot firmware files.
  Above is really sub-optimal design of the Raspberry Pi boards but a
  limitation that we must live with.
  Note that the DTB files are also part of "boot firmware" and included in
  the state script update.
  The provided state-script can be enabled by adding the following to e.g
  local.conf:
      INHERIT += "rpi-update-firmware"
  The ArtifactInstall_Leave_50 script can be overriden to customize what
  files to update, e.g only DTB files. By default all files on the boot
  part will be updated including config.txt and cmdline.txt.
  NOTE! Updating the boot firmware files can not be done atomically and the
  files are not roll-backed even though an rootfs rollback is performed. Conclusion,
  this is an risky operating which could brick your device.
* Fix infinite loop which would eat all available memory
  on the build host, when using U-Boot v2020.01 or later together with
  the auto-patcher.
  ([MEN-3265](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3265))
* Updated the LIC_FILES_CHECKSUM after removing dependencies
  ([MEN-3251](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3251))
* mender: Add sanity check for partuuid and uboot.
* grubenv: Handle debug command prompt when running as EFI
  app.
* write GPT partition table before resize of data part
  ([MEN-3366](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3366))
* raspberrypi: busybox compatibility for boot firmware state script
* grub: Move dynamic storage handling into grub-mender-grubenv repository.
* U-Boot versions from v2020.01 onwards have moved several C
  code defines into Kconfig, which may require changes in board specific
  patches. Specifically, `CONFIG_ENV_SIZE`, `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET` and
  `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND` now need to be defined in the board's
  `defconfig` file. In addition, the redundant environment now need to
  be specifically enabled, using the new switch,
  `CONFIG_SYS_REDUNAND_ENVIRONMENT`. If you are using
  `MENDER_UBOOT_AUTO_CONFIGURE=1`, then this is handled automatically,
  but if not you will need to add this to your board's `defconfig` file:
  ```
  CONFIG_SYS_REDUNAND_ENVIRONMENT=y
  CONFIG_ENV_SIZE=0x20000
  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET=0x800000
  CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND=0x1000000
  ```
  Note that the values may differ from the values you actually need,
  these are just the defaults from the meta-mender Yocto
  layer. `CONFIG_ENV_SIZE` need to match the `MENDER_ENV_SIZE` Bitbake
  variable, and `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET` and `CONFIG_ENV_OFFSET_REDUND`
  should (usually) be 1x and 2x the `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`
  variable. If the values are not as expected, then you will get an
  error during the compile stage.
* Fix OOM issue on the build host if certain configuration
  options are missing from the defconfig file.
  ([MEN-3476](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3476))
* grub-mender-grubenv: Remove kernel_devicetree.
  The only way to use GRUB 2.04 on ARM is via UEFI, and the
  kernel_devicetree information is not used when loading via UEFI,
  instead it is queried directly from the UEFI provider.
* Make sure that mender-grow-data.service only runs once.
* Boot no longer blocks while the data part is resized, and
  instead this is a background process.
* Add OpenSSL as dependency for Git versions of the Mender client.
* Fix U-Boot auto-patcher sometimes adding two conflicting
  options to the defconfig file.
  ([MEN-3514](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3514))
* Add mender-client_2.3.0b1 and mender-artifact_3.4.0b1 recipes.
  To use the Beta recipes, add this to `local.conf`:
  ```
  PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-client = "2.3.0b1"
  PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-artifact = "3.4.0b1"
  PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-artifact-native = "3.4.0b1"
  ```
* Add mender-binary-delta_1.1.0b1 recipe.
  To use the beta, add this to `local.conf`:
  ```
  PREFERRED_VERSION_pn-mender-binary-delta = "1.1.0b1"
  ```
* Disable `64bit` ext4 filesystem feature.
  ([MEN-3513](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3513))
* Remove mender-client < 2.2, and mender-artifact < 3.3 recipes.

* mender-grub: Dynamically determine mender_grub_storage_device.
* mender-grub: Add regexp module.
* Deprecate MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE variable.
* Updated the LIC_FILES_CHECKSUM after removing dependencies
  ([MEN-3251](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3251))
* raspberrypi: add state script to update boot firmware
  Raspberry Pi boards have a set of boot firmware files that are
  located on the vfat boot part, and these files are not updated
  when you perform an update of the root filesystem.
  Occasionally there will be changes to the Raspberry Pi software stack
  that requires that these files are update. Typically there is something
  in the Linux kernel that requires something that is in the boot
  firmware. This means that to update the Linux kernel you must also
  update the boot firmware files.
  Above is really sub-optimal design of the Raspberry Pi boards but a
  limitation that we must live with.
  Note that the DTB files are also part of "boot firmware" and included in
  the state script update.
  The provided state-script can be enabled by adding the following to e.g
  local.conf:
      INHERIT += "rpi-update-firmware"
  The ArtifactInstall_Leave_50 script can be overriden to customize what
  files to update, e.g only DTB files. By default all files on the boot
  part will be updated including config.txt and cmdline.txt.
  NOTE! Updating the boot firmware files can not be done atomically and the
  files are not roll-backed even though an rootfs rollback is performed. Conclusion,
  this is an risky operating which could brick your device.

### Changelogs

#### deployments (1.9.0)

New changes in deployments since 1.8.1:

* run migrations on startup like other services do
  ([MC-1144](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MC-1144))

* Set a timeout (5 seconds) for CreateBucket at start up
* index deployments database
  ([MEN-2019](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2019))
* store: Migrate to official MongoDB driver

#### deployments-enterprise (1.9.0)

New changes in deployments-enterprise since 1.8.1:

* Disallow empty batches in phased rollouts
  Previously there was a possibility to end up with an empty batch, due
  to the formula used in the calculation for the number of devices which
  is based on extracting a percentage number of devices from the total. Thus
  if the total is so small, that a percentage below some number rounds to zero,
  the batch would be empty. Now that same input will return an error.
  ([MEN-2810](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2810))
* FIX: Concurrent updates to phase device counter are made atomic
* run migrations on startup like other services do
  ([MC-1144](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MC-1144))
* fix device count for get deployment id
* Migration to official mongodb driver
* Set a timeout (5 seconds) for CreateBucket at start up
* index deployments database

* fixed empty userData on edit, causing blank ui fields in settings & header
* fixed persistence of helptip dismissal during onboarding
* fixed regression: filtered on device-type before deployment
* ensured device groups are sorted when retrieved from backend
* added device status inidicator in devicelist
* added billing information page to display current & past billing status
* included inprogress deployments in progress visualisation
* fixed device filtering by url parameter
* fixed deployment device list pagination & device id display
* made deployments refresh more frequently if appropriate
* made selected device id show up when settings dialog is opened
* fixed an issue that caused the proper error to be hidden when an artifact could not be changed
* adjusted deployment report to improve release name readability
* fixed an issue that broke the deployments list alignment
* made releaseslist sortable
* enabled release filtering by name, description & device types
* added additional onboarding steps to ease update artifact generation
* fixed an issue that prevented the staying logged in functionality from working
* prevented a redirect after deployment creation

#### integration (2.3.0)

New changes in integration since 2.3.0b1:

* Fix broken artifact creation in the UI.
  ([MEN-3166](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3166))

* Upgrade useradm-enterprise to 1.10.0.
* Upgrade workflows to 1.0.0.

New changes in integration since 2.2.1:

* Fix issue when demo script exists abruptly on user request
  for logs. The issue only showed up when the folder name contained "-"
  or "." characters.
* Add enterprise enabling flag to enterprise composition GUI
  container, so that the enterprise features are shown in the Frontend.
* Fix - Make sure the demo-script subprocess has a stdin fd
  ([MEN-2836](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2836))
* Fix - Create explicit exitcond for the demo setup fixture
  ([MEN-2836](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2836))
* Change Enterprise Docker links to registry.mender.io.
  This will be our gateway to serve the Enterprise images, not Docker
  Hub. Those who are using Enterprise will need to log into this
  gateway:
  ```
  docker login -u $USERNAME registry.mender.io
  ```
  where `$USERNAME` is the username given to you from Northern.tech. You
  will be prompted for the password.
* Verify that empty batches returns a 400 error
  Added a test for verifying that deployments-enterprise returns a 400 error
  in case of the number of devices in a batch being empty due to rounding
  errors in relation to the formula used for determining the number of devices
  in a batch. ([MEN-2838](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2838))
* Backend Integration tests always print "tests failed"; fix.
* Remove the Python dependency in the demo script
  Remove the Python dependency in the demo script, to decrease the dependency
  surface of the demo script.
  Now the Mender-Artifact and Mender versions are parsed from the
  docker-compose.client.yml and other-components.yml files through a simple AWK
  script instead.
  ([MEN-2817](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2817))
* Unskip the Pre-Auth tests
  ([MEN-1797](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1797))
* Enable logging for minio
  ([MEN-2922](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2922))
* [tests/run.sh] Enable passing on quoted arguments to pytest
* Run workflows with automigrate in production

New changes in inventory since 1.6.0:

* support for new mongo-driver
  ([MEN-2454](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2454), [MEN-2801](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2801))

#### mender (2.2.0)

New changes in mender since 2.2.0b1:

* Remove text/template dependency from the cli library reducing
  mender client binary size by approximately 20%
* Fix "State transition loop detected" when retrying status update.

New changes in mender since 2.1.2:

* mender setup cli command and new CLI package
  ([MEN-2418](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2418), [MEN-2806](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2806))
* Fix UBI device size calculation
* store: Save artifact provides for dependency verifications
* app: Verify artifact (version >= 3) dependencies with current artifact
* store/app{standalone}: Artifact dependency checking for artifact v3
* app/store{standalone}: Unit tests Artifact v3 depends and provides
* Enable the usage of the full Mender-Artifact version 3 format
  ([MEN-2642](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2642))
* support: modules-artifact-gen: Fix typo in default name of output file
* Rename --mender-professional flag to --hosted-mender
* Add --quiet flag and remove --run-daemon option and confirm device
* Now the client stores Artifact provides parameters across reboots in
  standalone mode. Previously this data was ignored, and hence upgrading with an
  Artifact with provides parameters these were lost.
  ([MEN-2969](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2969))
* Set default device type to hostname for interactive setup
* New command: `snapshot dump` to dump current rootfs
* Skip special device "rootfs" when determining rootfs type
* Report 'Unknown' rootfs type if we can't detect it
* Optimize rootfs-update image writes
  ([MEN-2939](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2939))
* Make `single-file-artifact-gen` script POSIX compliant.
  ([MEN-3049](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3049))
* Fix segfault when running `mender setup` on a read-only
  filesystem.
* Fix crash when specified certificate can't be opened.
  Both the `ServerCertificate` setting and the system certificates are
  now optional, in the sense that the client will run without them.
  However, the client will not be able to connect without the right
  certificates, so the main usecase of this change is to have a workable
  client that will roll back if connections can't be made, instead of
  exiting. ([MEN-3047](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3047))
* Add warning message when server certificate can't be parsed.
* snapshot: Added watchdog timer to keep system from freezing
* snapshot: Add compression options to speed up transfer
* Improved error message when an update-module is missing
  ([MEN-3007](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3007))
* snapshot: New flag `--source` specifying the source
  filesystem to snapshot

#### mender-api-gateway-docker (2.1.0)

New changes in mender-api-gateway-docker since 2.0.0:

* ssl_trusted_certificate added
* SSL termination can be turned off via environment variable

#### mender-artifact (3.3.0)

New changes in mender-artifact since 3.2.1:

* Adds API for returning all Artifact provides and depends
  ([MEN-2549](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2549))
* Enables Artifact Provides and Depends for write rootfs-img
  Previously, the `write rootfs-image` command did not have the ability
  to set Provides and Depends in the artifact. This was only enabled for
  the `write module-image` command. Now the `rootfs-image` update can
  also set Provides and Depends. However, please note that meta-data
  and augmented Provides and Depends still are unsupported.
  ([MEN-2812](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2812))
* Fix bug that destroys Artifact if any copy/modify command
  is used on a non-rootfs-image Artifact.
  ([MEN-2592](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2592))
* The `modify` subcommand has gained the `-k`/`--key`
  argument to automatically sign the Artifact after modification.
  ([MEN-2592](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2592))
* Remove superfluous "Files" header from `read` output.
* Fix incorrect help string for signed artifacts.
  If no key was provided, it said that the signature verification
  failed, but it should instruct the user to provide a key.
* Fix state scripts being lost when modifying artifact.
* One can now use `mender-artifact modify` to change artifact
  Depends, Provides and Meta-data attributes. See the help screen for
  more information.
  ([MEN-1669](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1669))
* `mender-artifact modify --name` argument renamed to
  `--artifact-name` to match the rest of the tool's flags. The old flag
  is still kept for compatibility.
  ([MEN-1669](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1669))
* Make artifact install respect the given file permissions
  ([MEN-2880](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2880))
* Added the writing of the `rootfs_image_checksum` provide parameter as
  a default to `rootfs-image` Artifacts. This means that now, the
  `rootfs_image_checksum` will be written as a provide parameter to the Mender
  client's database upon an update with the given Artifact. Please note that for
  older clients (i.e. <= 2.1.x) this will not work, and the functionality should
  be disabled by the user through the `--no-checksum-provide` flag when writing a
  rootfs-image Artifact.
  ([MEN-2956](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2956))
* Create artifact from device snapshot

### Changelogs

#### gui (2.2.2)

New changes in gui since 2.2.1:

* fix: removed superfluous " around tenant token in device config code
* Fix for changing page length for pagination of rejected and preauth devices
* fixed deploymentdevicelist lacking device identity information
* fixed device list refresh after page length change in deployment devicelist
* fixed an issue that prevented the staying logged in functionality from working

#### integration (2.2.2)

New changes in integration since 2.2.1:

* Upgrade gui to 2.2.2.
* Upgrade mender to 2.1.3.

#### mender (2.1.3)

New changes in mender since 2.1.2:

* Fix crash when specified certificate can't be opened.
  Both the `ServerCertificate` setting and the system certificates are
  now optional, in the sense that the client will run without them.
  However, the client will not be able to connect without the right
  certificates, so the main usecase of this change is to have a workable
  client that will roll back if connections can't be made, instead of
  exiting. ([MEN-3047](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-3047))
* Add warning message when server certificate can't be parsed.

### Changelogs

#### deployments (1.8.0)

New changes in deployments since 1.7.1:

* Fix "unexpected EOF" errors when the source of the artifact
  is a slow network stream.
* Fix spurious upload errors due to wrong EOF handling.
* Fix inability to resume partial migration.

#### deployments-enterprise (1.8.0)

New changes in deployments-enterprise since 1.8.0b1:

* Disallow empty batches in phased rollouts
  Previously there was a possibility to end up with an empty batch, due
  to the formula used in the calculation for the number of devices which
  is based on extracting a percentage number of devices from the total. Thus
  if the total is so small, that a percentage below some number rounds to zero,
  the batch would be empty. Now that same input will return an error.
  ([MEN-2810](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2810))

#### deviceauth (2.1.0)

New changes in deviceauth since 2.1.0b1:

* additional mongodb index added

New changes in deviceauth since 2.0.0:

* Add support for default tenant token.
  It can be used to allow devices that don't have a tenant token to be
  allowed into a specific tenant's list of devices. Enable it either
  using the `DEVICEAUTH_DEFAULT_TENANT_TOKEN` environment variable, or
  the `default_tenant_token` setting in `config.yaml`.
  ([MEN-2705](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2705), [MEN-2706](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2706))

#### gui (2.2.0)

New changes in gui since 2.2.0b1:

* disabled onboarding steps in enterprise environments
* added frontend validation to disable empty batches in phased deployments
  ([MEN-2820](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2820))
* prevented an error in finished deployments view
* fixed phased deployment progress calculation
* added support for raspberrypi4 during onboarding
* moved retry deployment to use createdeployment dialog for review
* Fixed a bug that broke the pagination in the finished deployments list
* added 2fa setup validation step
* added possibility to select previous deployment patterns
* disabled browser suggestions on autoselects
* added starttime column to deployments list in enterprise

New changes in gui since 2.1.0:

* limited height of large select lists to prevent them from hiding input
* ensured artifact & group sort order during deployment scheduling
* added closed feature notifications to show in open source UI
* Updated deployment creation UI to wizard for phased deployments

#### integration (2.2.0)

New changes in integration since 2.2.0b1:

* Fix - Create explicit exitcond for the demo setup fixture
  ([MEN-2836](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2836))
* Change Enterprise Docker links to registry.mender.io.
  This will be our gateway to serve the Enterprise images, not Docker
  Hub. Those who are using Enterprise will need to log into this
  gateway:
  ```
  docker login -u $USERNAME registry.mender.io
  ```
  where `$USERNAME` is the username given to you from Northern.tech. You
  will be prompted for the password.
* Add enterprise enabling flag to enterprise composition GUI
  container, so that the enterprise features are shown in the Frontend.
* Upgrade deployments to 1.8.0.
* Upgrade deployments-enterprise to 1.8.0.
* Upgrade deviceauth to 2.1.0.
* Upgrade gui to 2.2.0.
* Upgrade mender-artifact to 3.2.0.
* Upgrade mender-conductor to 1.5.0.
* Upgrade mender-conductor-enterprise to 1.5.0.
* Upgrade tenantadm to 1.0.0.
* Upgrade useradm to 1.9.0.
* Upgrade useradm-enterprise to 1.9.0.
* Fix - Make sure the demo-script subprocess has a stdin fd
  ([MEN-2836](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2836))

New changes in integration since 2.1.0:

* remove default conductor config file
* Fix error: `No such container: integration-2.1.0b1_mender-useradm_1`
* Introduced `enterprise.yml` template in production
  directory to install an Enterprise backend server.
* The old `template` directory has been replaced with a
  dedicated `production` directory, and templates are now provided as
  single files with the `.template` suffix instead. These should be
  copied to their non-`.template` location before being used. The `run`
  script should no longer be copied, and if it already exists in the
  `production` directory before merging this change, it should be
  removed before attempting to merge or rebase.
* The `prod.yml` file has been moved into a `config`
  subfolder. Users with downstream repositories need to move their
  `prod.yml` as well.
* Enable tenantadm as an Enterprise release component.
* Enable tenantadm as an Enterprise release component.
* Fix issue when demo script exists abruptly on user request
  for logs. The issue only showed up when the folder name contained "-"
  or "." characters.
* Upgrade deployments to 1.8.0b1.
* Upgrade deployments-enterprise to 1.8.0b1.
* Upgrade deviceauth to 2.1.0b1.
* Upgrade gui to 2.2.0b1.

* Upgrade mender-artifact to 3.2.0b1.
* Upgrade mender-conductor to 1.5.0b1.
* Upgrade mender-conductor-enterprise to 1.5.0b1.
* Upgrade tenantadm to 1.0.0b1.
* Upgrade useradm to 1.9.0b1.
* Upgrade useradm-enterprise to 1.9.0b1.

#### mender (2.1.1)

New changes in mender since 2.1.0:

* module/single-file: fix rollback state by correctly defining filename
* Check for -f option in stat command
* Set hard limit(10) for client update status report retries
  This fixes an issue where the maxSendingAttemps in
  updateReportRetry state could be set real high, since it is calculated
  as UpdatePollIntervalSeconds / RetryPollIntervalSeconds. This adds a
  hard upper limit of 10 retries for the client in any case.
  ([MEN-2676](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2676))

#### mender-artifact (3.2.0)

New changes in mender-artifact since 3.1.0:

* 'mender-artifact cp' now requires '-' in order to read stdin
  ([MEN-2745](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2745))
* Fix error where files larger than the buffer used by
  io.Copy() was not buffered when mender-artifact cp read from stdin.
  This means that now, ``` mender-artfact cp - mender.artifact:/in/img/path```
  will successfully copy larger files.
* fix erroneously report of "-dirty" in the version
  string. ([MEN-2800](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2800))
* Fix build-contained Makefile: image was missing make install
* Update the type-info documentation in the version 3 artifact format
  This commit updates the description of the values allowed in the type-info
  headers in the version 3 of the artifact format. Formerly only the key
  `rootfs-image-checksum` was allowed, while now, any key is allowed, with
  the only allowed value types being string, or array of strings.
* Allow `--compression` to be specified after command.
  This allows it to be appended to the command, which makes it usable
  with `--` style arguments to Update Module Artifact generators.
* Enable typeinfo artifact-depends/provides string and []string values
  Previously the artifact-depends key in the type-info header was restricted
  to contain a single key `rootfs-image-checksum`. This restriction has now
  been lifted, and the key can now contain arbitrary string, and []string values.
* Fix: mender-artifact modify did not clean up the
  temp-files created
  ([MEN-2758](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2758))
* Mender-Artifact format version 1 is hereby no longer supported,
  and neither reading or writing the version 1 of the format is no longer
  supported. Please move to using a newer version.
  ([MEN-2156](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2156))
* mender-artifact will now fail to validate a signed Artifact
  if no validation key is specified. No behaviour change for unsigned
  Artifacts. ([MEN-2802](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2802))

#### mender-conductor (1.5.0)

New changes in mender-conductor since 1.4.0:

* update conductor from 2.2.0 to 2.11.0; fix configuration
* startup script modified
* copy default configuration into the image

#### mender-conductor-enterprise (1.5.0)

  which can be used to recreate the same artifact from the dumped files.
  ([MEN-2580](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2580))
* Added a build step for macOS to the Travis build.
* `mender-artifact modify` does not support anymore signing the
  Artifact after the modification. Use `mender-convert sign` after the

  ([MEN-2318](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2318))
* file-install modules: Don't destroy original before we know we have a backup.

* Add source-installation instructions to README.md.
* Add `rootfs-image-v2` as a demonstration of how to
  reimplement Mender's `rootfs-image` update type as an update module.
  It's also useful as inspiration if users want to make their own
  slightly tweaked rootfs-image type.
  ([MEN-2392](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2392))
* Swapped definition of StateScriptRetryTimeout and
  StateScriptRetryInterval for the names to represent what they are
  actually doing. This change breaks compatibility with current usage of

* Updated the copyright year to 2019 in LICENSE.

  ([MEN-2000](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2000))
* Add support for Mender Artifact format version 3.
  ([MEN-2000](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2000))
* Artifact name is now stored in the local database, and
  `/etc/mender/artifact_info` acts only as a fallback if no name has
  been stored yet. This is typically the case for devices provisioned
  directly from a disk image. Scripts should use the client
  `-show-artifact` argument instead of parsing the file.
  ([MEN-2000](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2000))
* `-rootfs` argument has been removed and replaced with the
  `-install` argument, which works the same way.
  ([MEN-2000](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2000))
* Mender now runs a stripped down set of state scripts when
  installing artifacts in standalone mode, and the `-f` flag is no
  longer required to install such artifacts, nor is it valid. The
  scripts that run are:
  * `Download` scripts
  * `ArtifactInstall` scripts
  * `ArtifactCommit` scripts
  * `ArtifactRollback` scripts

  after an `ArtifactCommit_Leave` script has returned an error.

  The device_type file is not supported, since it is highly hardware
  specific. Also the configuration will be very bare bones, and will
  require changes unless Hosted Mender is being used.
  ([MEN-2383](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2383))
* Make output from `-show-artifact` easier to consume by limiting logging.
* Fix state logic for the case of actual wait

  ([MEN-2286](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2286))

  provided were modified, but not repacked. This fix updates the logic, and added
  a test specifically for sdimg, as they we're non-existent.

### Changelogs

#### meta-mender (thud-v2018.12)

New changes in meta-mender since sumo-v2018.11.2:

* Add mender-artifact 2.4.0b1 recipe.
* Make mkfs.ubifs and ubinize arguments a bit more customizable.
  The new variables `MENDER_FLASH_MINIMUM_IO_UNIT` and
  `MENDER_MAXIMUM_LEB_COUNT` have been introduced, which maps directly
  to the corresponding arguments of the two tools.
* Beaglebone builds no longer compatible with builds from sumo and older.
  The reason is that bootloader switched to GRUB. The old build type can
  be restored by removing `mender-grub` and adding `mender-uboot` to
  `DISTRO_FEATURES` using the `MENDER_FEATURES` variables.
* Fix `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXCLUDE_PATH` failing when listing a non-existent path.
* Increase default u-boot MTD partition size to 1MiB.
* Fix inability to patch old u-boot variants of MTDPARTS and
  MTDIDS correctly.
  ([MEN-1849](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1849))
* Add mender 1.7.0b1 recipe.
* Fix images not being modifiable by mender-artifact in thud and later.
* Add mender 1.5.1 recipe.
* Add mender 1.6.0 recipe.
* Add mender-artifact 2.3.0 recipe.
* Remove support for `loadaddr` variable and
  `CONFIG_LOADADDR` config setting in U-Boot. This only affects boards
  that use U-Boot as a first stage bootloader in order to use UEFI to
  load GRUB as the second stage bootloader. For most boards it should
  not be problematic, since most support `kernel_addr_r`. If there is
  a problem however, it might be necessary to forward port [this
  patch](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender/blob/b39aa8aeecdf2b8cce3dbcce25ec044073568348/meta-mender-core/recipes-bsp/u-boot/patches/0007-distro_bootcmd-Switch-bootefi-to-use-loadaddr-by-def.patch)
  to the U-Boot version in question.
* Fix boot directory being excluded from thud images
* Add some debug functionality to GRUB booting process.
  To use it, enable either or both of `debug-log` and `debug-pause` in
  `PACKAGECONFIG` for `grub-mender-grubenv`. The former enables debug
  logging in GRUB, which can be tweaked further by setting the
  `DEBUG_LOG_CATEGORY` variable. The latter pauses the boot process at
  strategic points during the boot, so that screen output can be
  captured before it is cleared or scrolls by.
* Fix build error when using any hard drive besides sda/hda, such as sdb.
* Images partitioned with GPT or MSDOS partition tables are
  now padded up to the nearest alignment specified in
  `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`. Previously the last block might be
  shorter.
* Remove meta-mender-orangepi and meta-mender-toradex-nxp
  as these will be moved to meta-mender-community for the next stable
  branch (thud)
* Make sure mtdimg is not truncated, but has its full length.
* Enable EXTERNALSRC to be used with u-boot-fw-utils-mender-auto-provided.
* Allow disabling auto-generated /etc/fstab
* mender: Enable systemd in mender-systemd FEATURE handling.
  As long as `mender-systemd` feature is enabled, it is no longer
  necessary to include the block:
  ```
  DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " systemd"
  VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
  DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "sysvinit"
  VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
  ```
* Add canary value to U-Boot env to catch bootloader/user-space mismatch.
* GRUB: Fix error about devicetree command not being found.
* Change default storage on x86 to memory card (mmcblk0).
* Reduce partitioning overhead by default.
  The current value of 4 * alignment is excessive, since we now take
  alignment into account when calculating rootfs size. Instead, only
  count overhead lost to partition table, which is 2 * alignment.
* mender: Allow overrides for MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB_DEFAULT.
* Allow boot partition to be populated with normal package recipes.
* Fix `MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE` variable not being respected.
  ([MEN-2048](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2048))
* GRUB: Make kernel console argument configurable using "console_bootargs".
  One can set this variable in some "xx_*_grub.cfg" script with an index
  lower than 10, in the grub-mender-grubenv recipe.
* uboot_auto_patch: Switch kernel address from `loadaddr`
  back to `kernel_addr_r`. This was discussed with U-Boot developers and
  is the proper address variable going forward.
* Fix incorrect Flash bad PEB calculation which led to wrong total image size.
  ([MEN-1849](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1849))
* Add mender 1.6.1 and 1.7.0 recipes.
* Add mender-artifact 2.3.1 and 2.4.0 recipes.
* Auto-select correct `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE_BASE` scheme.
  This should rarely need to be set by anyone anymore.
* Fix confusing warning flood when MENDER_MTDIDS is unset in a UBI build.
* Switch image names from containing `MACHINE` to containing
  `MENDER_DEVICE_TYPE`. So for example, if you have a build for the
  raspberrypi3 machine type, with device type of "prod_rpi3", the image
  will now be called `core-image-minimal-prod_rpi3.sdimg` instead of
  `core-image-minimal-raspberrypi3.sdimg`.
* Fix console logging for systemd on QEMU.
* Fix build error when using GRUB and /dev/mmcblk storage device.
* Add specific patches for u-boot-toradex_2016.11.
  ([MEN-1849](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1849))
* grub: Remove restriction that the core.img be at sector 1
* mender-uboot: Use hex for dev/part numbers in U-Boot.
* Delete all components from pre-1.5 Mender releases.
  Remove Mender 1.4.0 and 1.4.1 and Mender artifact 2.2.0.
* Introduce support for a standardized boot method on ARM
  using UEFI and GRUB. The UEFI boot standard is fully supported on ARM
  in theory, but few board manufacturers implement it in practice.
  Therefore U-Boot is still utilized, but acts only as a UEFI loader,
  and hence no U-Boot integration is needed. All boot scripts are then
  handled by GRUB, which needs no patching.
  ([MEN-1595](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1595), [MEN-1659](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1659))
* Add support for PARTUUID in grub-mender-grubenv script.
* Remove colibri-imx7-mender MACHINE type, replaced by colibri-imx7.
* Fix regression that removed boot flag from boot partition.
* Fix regression that caused Beaglebone to not boot.
* QEMU: Always try to run with KVM enabled, only fall back to emulation.
* Fix license checksum sometimes failing in
  `u-boot-fw-utils-mender-auto-provided` recipe when U-Boot fork has a
  slightly different README file.
* Add PARTUUID generation and integration
* Change default bootloader to GRUB on all non-UBI platforms.
  U-Boot will still be used on ARM platforms to provide UEFI that GRUB
  can use, but it will not be used for Mender integration. To opt out,
  and keep using traditional U-Boot integration, remove `mender-grub`,
  and add `mender-uboot` using the `MENDER_FEATURES` variables.
* Fixed support for raspberrypi3-64 and aarch64
* mender-uboot: Allow multi-digit partition/device nums.
* Add mender 1.6.0b1 and mender-artifact 2.3.0b1 recipes.
* Remove obsolete mender pre-1.4 and mender-artifact pre-2.2 recipes.
* Fix regression in QEMU launching after changing image name in 897195ddc3f.
* Replaced default yocto cfg file for grub pre configuration by the proper cfg file without redundant and erroneous search command.
* rpi: update U-boot patch to get rid of warning
* Fix incorrect license tag for mender-artifact recipe.
  Little practical difference, since they are all permissive licenses.
* Fix missing wpa_supplicant in Raspberry Pi demo images.
* GRUB: Pass kernel arguments from bootargs variable instead of hard coded.
  This allows it to be overridden or modified by adding a script snippet
  which sets the variable.
  Also log kernel messages to both screen and serial port by default,
  and have systemd log to serial port (last "console" argument,
  apparently it cannot log to both).
* Add support for GPT BIOS images
* Boot script recipe for demoing OTA updates

* A command of the form
  "mender-artifact validate unsigned.mender -k public.key"
  was incorrectly succeeding for an unsigned artifact when a public key
  was supplied. Supplying a public key indicates that the caller requires
  the artifact to contain a signature that matches that key.

  ([MEN-2155](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2155))
* FIX: Renaming a file across devices now works.
  ([MEN-2166](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2166))
* FIX: mender-artifact cat,cp,modify etc no longer removes the update.
  Previously an update present in a directory, with the same name as the
  update present in an update would be removed as a result of what the
  functions thought was tmp-files.
  ([MEN-2171](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2171))
* Fixed a bug that caused a command like
  "mender-artifact cat signed.mender:/etc/mender/artifact_info"
  to fail with the error:
  "failed to open the partition reader: err: error validating signature"
  There was a similar problem with the "cp" command, and also
  the "modify" command when no "-k" was present to replace the
  existing signature.

New changes in mender-conductor-enterprise since 1.1.0:

* Latest template from Ralph.

#### useradm (1.7.0)

## meta-mender sumo-v2018.10

_Released 10.03.2018_

#### meta-mender (sumo-v2018.10)

New changes in meta-mender since sumo-v2018.09:

* Make sure mtdimg is not truncated, but has its full length.
* Add specific patches for u-boot-toradex_2016.11.
  ([MEN-1849](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1849))
* Fix incorrect Flash bad PEB calculation which led to wrong total image size.
  ([MEN-1849](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1849))
* Make mkfs.ubifs and ubinize arguments a bit more customizable.
  The new variables `MENDER_FLASH_MINIMUM_IO_UNIT` and
  `MENDER_MAXIMUM_LEB_COUNT` have been introduced, which maps directly
  to the corresponding arguments of the two tools.
* Fix inability to patch old u-boot variants of MTDPARTS and
  MTDIDS correctly.
  ([MEN-1849](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1849))

## meta-mender sumo-v2018.09

_Released 09.13.2018_

#### meta-mender (sumo-v2018.09)

New changes in meta-mender since sumo-v2018.08:

* Fix regression in QEMU launching after changing image name in 897195ddc3f.
* GRUB: Pass kernel arguments from bootargs variable instead of hard coded.
  This allows it to be overridden or modified by adding a script snippet
  which sets the variable.
  Also log kernel messages to both screen and serial port by default,
  and have systemd log to serial port (last "console" argument,
  apparently it cannot log to both).
* Introduce support for a standardized boot method on ARM
  using UEFI and GRUB. The UEFI boot standard is fully supported on ARM
  in theory, but few board manufacturers implement it in practice.
  Therefore U-Boot is still utilized, but acts only as a UEFI loader,
  and hence no U-Boot integration is needed. All boot scripts are then
  handled by GRUB, which needs no patching.
  ([MEN-1595](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1595), [MEN-1659](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1659))
* Auto-select correct `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE_BASE` scheme.
  This should rarely need to be set by anyone anymore.
* Add some debug functionality to GRUB booting process.
  To use it, enable either or both of `debug-log` and `debug-pause` in
  `PACKAGECONFIG` for `grub-mender-grubenv`. The former enables debug
  logging in GRUB, which can be tweaked further by setting the
  `DEBUG_LOG_CATEGORY` variable. The latter pauses the boot process at
  strategic points during the boot, so that screen output can be
  captured before it is cleared or scrolls by.
* GRUB: Fix error about devicetree command not being found.
* Images partitioned with GPT or MSDOS partition tables are
  now padded up to the nearest alignment specified in
  `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`. Previously the last block might be
  shorter.
* Fix build error when using GRUB and /dev/mmcblk storage device.
* Fix build error when using any hard drive besides sda/hda, such as sdb.
* Fix `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXCLUDE_PATH` failing when listing a non-existent path.
* Fix `MENDER_GRUB_STORAGE_DEVICE` variable not being respected.
  ([MEN-2048](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-2048))
* Allow disabling auto-generated /etc/fstab
* Boot script recipe for demoing OTA updates
* mender: Allow overrides for MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB_DEFAULT.
* mender-uboot: Use hex for dev/part numbers in U-Boot.
* Add mender 1.5.1 recipe.
* Add mender 1.6.0 recipe.
* Add mender-artifact 2.3.0 recipe.

* mender-uboot: Add MENDER_UBOOT_POST_SETUP_COMMANDS config point.
* Fix occasional inode corruption issue when re-launching a
  previously launched and saved QEMU image.
* QEMU: Limit client setup steps to run on first boot only.
* mender-qemu: increase qemu memory size to 256MiB.
* Let colibri-imx7 and vf boards be handled by automatic patching.

  ([MEN-1657](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1657))
* Add mender-1.3.1 and mender-artifact-2.1.2 recipes.
* Implement `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXCLUDE_PATH` support. It works the
  following way: It contains a space separated list of directories,
  relative to the rootfs root (no beginning slash), and any directory
  specified will be omitted from the rootfs. If the directory ends in a
  slash, only the contents will be omitted, not the directory itself
  (useful for mount points). One can then set
  `do_image_<imagetype>[respect_exclude_path] = "1"` for certain image
  builders to prevent the exclusion and then add them back as separate
  partitions there.
* Support for `MENDER_DATA_PART_DIR` has been removed. Use
  recipe files to add files directly to the `/data` directory instead.
* mender: Create bmap files.
* tests: Filter out the data partition as the latest build artifact.
* example-state-scripts: Explicitly return 0 from scripts.
* uboot_auto_patch: Simplify definition placement at the expense of beauty.
  The resulting patch is uglier because the definitions go into a cross
  platform section which is not appropriate for upstream submission. But
  it does fix the case where unwanted ifdefs were "hiding" the added
  definitions.
* rpi_0_w: Setup Mender required defconfigs
* Implement GRUB and x86-64 support.

* Use timedatectl, if available, to determine with time is synchronized.
* mender upgraded to 1.4.0.
* mender-artifact upgraded to 2.2.0.
* mender-qemu: More robust detection of MACHINE setting.
* beaglebone: Rename to beaglebone-yocto.
* Add mtdimg image type.
  The mtdimg type is an image type meant to be flashed to the entire
  Flash device, unlike the ubimg, which should only be flashed to the
  ubi area of the mtd device. Either one can be used depending on need.
  vexpress-nor image, used in QEMU, was also changed to take advantage
  of the new mtdimg image.
  ([MEN-1597](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1597))
* Add LAYERSERIES_COMPAT settings to all Mender layers.
* Replace `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT_KB` with
  `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`, which is in bytes.
* Rename `MENDER_STORAGE_RESERVED_RAW_SPACE` to
  `MENDER_RESERVED_SPACE_BOOTLOADER_DATA`, to better reflect what it is
  used for.
* Enable wifi in the raspberry-pi demo image by default.
  ([MEN-1804](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1804))
* mender: Only create vfat boot partition if size is non-zero

* Fix fstab sometimes not containing boot partition entry.
* Fix build error if `IMAGE_FSTYPES` contains the same entry more than once.
* Implement x86 BIOS support together with GRUB.
  It can be enabled by inheriting the `mender-full-bios` class, or by
  enabling the `mender-grub` and `mender-bios` features using
  `MENDER_FEATURES_ENABLE`.
  ([MEN-1845](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1845))
* Client container init scripts are modified to accept MAC address for qemu through env var, `RANDOM_MAC`.
* added layer dependency on mender layer
* uboot_auto_configure: Fail immediately if a define cannot be added.
  Better than failing later at runtime, where the problem is much harder
  to debug.
* Warn on unused MENDER_.* variables
  ([MEN-1603](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1603))
* uboot_auto_patch: Switch kernel address from `kernel_addr_r` to `loadaddr`.
* Remove unused IMAGE_UENV_TXT_FILE variable.
* Add U-Boot auto patching support for Flash based devices.
  The autopatcher will use UBI as storage medium for both the
  filesystems and the U-Boot environment. Mender requires a minimum of
  configuration: the `MENDER_MTDIDS` needs to be set for the board, and
  will normally go in the `conf/machine/<MACHINE>.conf` file for the
  board in question. See documentation for variables `MENDER_MTDIDS`,
  `MENDER_IS_IN_MTDID` and `MENDER_MTDPARTS` for more information.
  ([MEN-1597](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1597))
* Partition alignment (`MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`) on Flash
  devices using UBI is now aligned to the UBI LEB size, which in general
  is not a multiple of KiB.
  ([MEN-1597](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1597))
* Add Mender 1.4.1 recipe.
* Clear IMAGE_NAME_SUFFIX for all image types.
* Fix "No rule to make target 'envtools'" error in some U-Boot builds.
* Pregenerate SSH keys for all QEMU images.
* Since the "beaglebone" machine name has changed in upstream
  to "beaglebone-yocto", add "beaglebone" to the
  `MENDER_DEVICE_TYPES_COMPATIBLE` default, so that older devices can
  upgrade even if they have the old device type.
* mender: Copy data partition images to the deploy dir.
* mender: Append to fstab rather than replacing it.
* Fix failed uboot.env install when mender-uboot feature is disabled.
* tests: Also check ARTIFACTIMG_FSTYPE for compatible images.
* uboot_auto_patch: Update to support U-Boot v2018.05.
* uboot_auto_patch: Add support for new Kconfig based
  defines.
* mender-uboot: Add MENDER_UBOOT_PRE_SETUP_COMMANDS config point.
* Add Mender 1.5.0 Beta recipe.
* Add mender-1.4.0b1 and mender-artifact-2.2.0b1 recipes.
* Add 'dataimg' as an image type.
  It contains the data partition filesystem which is normally part of
  the complete partitioned image. To enable it, add `dataimg` to
  `IMAGE_FSTYPES`.
  ([MEN-1879](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1879))
* mender: Use only the basename to load DTBs.
* Add Mender 1.5.0 recipe.
* Document SDIMG_ROOTFS_TYPE settings for Raspberry Pi.
* Change rootfs size calculation so it takes alignment into account.
  This should fix a few corner cases, where the filesystems may all fit
  in terms of bytes, but still would not actually fit because of
  partition alignment.
* Added new state script to wait for time sync to complete.
* Drop creation of `authtentoken` file, which is unneeded now.
* Added basic support for orangepi boards
* mender: Cleanup IMAGE_FSTYPES.
* uboot_auto_configure: Handle tabs in defines correctly.

  ([MEN-1417](https://tracker.mender.io/browse/MEN-1417))
* store/mongo: properly setup context for migrations in multi tenant

* Correctly fail state script execution if stderr can not be opened.
  It would not be impossible to continue execution in this case, but it
  is bad to lose log output, and not being able to open stderr is a
  pretty uncommon case that might indicate a more serious issue like
  resource starvation.
