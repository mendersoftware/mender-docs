## Yocto Project releases supported by meta-mender

The following [Yocto Project LTS releases](https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases?target=_blank)
are currently supported by [meta-mender](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender?target=_blank):

* Scarthgap (5.0)
* Kirkstone (4.0)

Each Yocto Project release has a corresponding branch in meta-mender.
Note that you will find other branches in meta-mender but they are not
updated during a future Mender release.


## Mender Artifact format support

The [Mender Artifact format](../../02.Overview/03.Artifact/docs.md) is versioned
to support new features over time. It is used by the Mender Client (to install Artifacts),
Mender Server (to parse and display meta-data, and to generate some types of Artifacts)
and the mender-artifact CLI utility (to create Artifacts).

| Artifact format | Client | Server | mender-artifact |
| --------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------- |
| Artifact v1     | 1.0    | 1.0    | 1.0             |
| Artifact v2     | 1.1    | 1.1    | 2.0             |
| Artifact v3     | 2.0    | 2.0    | 3.0             |

!!! Before you create Artifacts of a new format version, make sure that every Mender
component you use anywhere supports the version of the Artifact format.


## Device API version support

The compatibility between the Mender Server and Client is managed by the
[Device API](https://docs.mender.io/api/#device-apis?target=_blank#device-apis)
versions exposed by the Server and used by the Client.
If the Mender Server supports the API version of the Mender Client, they are compatible.

The higher version API contains a mix of old and new API endpoints. For endpoints which
have not changed in the new version, previous version ones are assumed. For example, if
the Device uses the v2 Device API, it expects
[this single v2 Deployments endpoint](https://docs.mender.io/api/?target=_blank#device-api-deployments-v2)
to be available. For all other endpoints it will use v1.

| Device API | Server | Gateway | Client |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| API v1     | 1.0    | N/A     | 1.0    |
| API v2     | 3.0    | 1.0     | 3.0    |

!!! Make sure to upgrade the Server first to support a new API version. Next it is
!!! recommended to update any Gateway components and finally Client.

!!! So far, Mender Server supports all Device API versions ever released. In other words,
!!! a current Mender Server will still work with Mender Client v1.0. However, it is good practice
!!! and required for commercial support to regularly update all your Mender components to
!!! ensure they all run supported versions. This will prevent issues in the future.


## Mender Client subcomponents
The Mender Client consists of several subcomponents. See the table below for a mapping
of which subcomponents are included in a given Mender Client version.

| Mender Client | mender-connect | mender-configure | mender-monitor | mender-binary-delta |
