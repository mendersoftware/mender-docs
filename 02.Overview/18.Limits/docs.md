This section gives an overview over important resource limits that help ensure the health and security of the Mender Server.

Many limits vary based on the [Device tier](../17.Device-tiers/docs.md) (standard, micro, or system). Device tiers classify devices by their capabilities and use cases.

### Polling interval: Update checks

The frequency with which a Device checks for updates. This varies by device tier.

| Device Tier | Default Interval            | Configuration                                                                                               |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Micro       | `604800 seconds` (7 days)   | [Mender MCU Client configuration](../../06.Operating-System-updates-Zephyr/04.Customize-Mender-mcu/docs.md) |
| Standard    | `1800 seconds` (30 minutes) | [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md)   |
| System      | `1800 seconds` (30 minutes) | [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md)   |

! Warning: Using _shorter_ than default intervals with hosted Mender is considered _excessive use_ and may trigger rate limiting,
! unless it is 10 devices or less for trial/testing or otherwise agreed upon in advance.

### Polling interval: Inventory updates

The frequency a Device can update its current inventory to the Mender Server. This varies by device tier.

| Device Tier | Default Interval          | Configuration                                                                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Micro       | `604800 seconds` (7 days) | [Mender MCU Client configuration](../../06.Operating-System-updates-Zephyr/04.Customize-Mender-mcu/docs.md) |
| Standard    | `28800 seconds` (8 hours) | [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md)   |
| System      | `28800 seconds` (8 hours) | [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md)   |

! Warning: Using _shorter_ than default intervals with hosted Mender is considered _excessive use_ and may trigger rate limiting,
! unless it is 10 devices or less for trial/testing or otherwise agreed upon in advance.

### Artifact size limits

| Tier     | Default Maximum Artifact Size | Notes                                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Micro    | 10 MiB                        | Limited by MCU flash memory, typically < 10 MiB       |
| Standard | 10 GiB                        | Configurable via `DEPLOYMENTS_STORAGE_MAX_IMAGE_SIZE` |
| System   | 10 GiB                        | Applies to Manifest Artifacts and component artifacts |

### Maximum number of download retries

The maximum number of times that mender-update retries continuing a download of an Artifact
that was interrupted e.g. by network issues.

Default: `10`</br>
Minimum: `1`</br>
Maximum: `10,000`

This is a Client side configuration, see [Mender Client configuration](../../03.Client-installation/07.Configuration/01.Polling-intervals/docs.md).

### Maximum size of API payload

The maximum size of API payload for all API calls unless otherwise specified affects POST API calls. If a deployment log is over this limit, it can fail to upload the log.

Default: `1 MiB`</br>
Override per service with the Mender Server environment variable: `service_REQUEST_SIZE_LIMIT` e.g. `DEPLOYMENTS_REQUEST_SIZE_LIMIT`

### Maximum size of single file uploads
The maximum size of single-file type Artifacts generated by the Mender Server with the [Generate Artifact endpoint](https://docs.mender.io/api/#management-api-deployments-generate-artifact).

Default: `256 MiB`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_STORAGE_MAX_GENERATE_DATA_SIZE`

### Maximum total size of Device inventory data store
The maximum size of a single Device inventory on the Mender Server is determined by the API upload limit

Default: `1 MiB`</br>
Overriding is done by INVENTORY_REQUEST_SIZE_LIMIT up to 10MB, which is the database limit.

### Maximum length of Release names
The maximum length of Release names when creating Releases on the Mender Server.

Default: `256 characters`</br>
Overriding this limit is not possible

### Maximum length of Mender Configure strings
The maximum length of keys and values in Mender Configure Device attributes.

Default: `4096 characters`</br>
Overriding this limit is not possible

### Maximum number of active deployments
The maximum number of active and pending deployments per tenant.

Default: `No limit`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_LIMIT_MAX_ACTIVE_DEPLOYMENTS`

! Warning: This limit is set to **800** active deployments per tenant on hosted Mender.

### Maximum number of tags per Device
The maximum number of tags that can be defined per Device inventory.

Default: `20`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `INVENTORY_LIMIT_TAGS`

### Maximum size of server-side delta Artifact
The maximum uncompressed size of the root file system in Mender Artifacts that you can use to trigger server-side binary delta generation.

Default: `5 GiB`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `DEPLOYMENTS_SERVER_SIDE_DELTA_GENERATION_MAX_ARTIFACT_SIZE_MB`
Note that the environment variable is represented in **MiB**, and its default value is `5120`.

### Audit log retention

The duration from when an event happened until the audit log is removed from the server.

Default: `365 days`</br>
Override with helm value `auditlogs.logRetentionSeconds`.
Note that the value is specified in seconds (365 days is 31536000 seconds).

### Maximum number of RBAC permission sets per Role
The maximum number of permission sets (e.g., User Management, Releases, Device Group Management) that can be assigned to a custom Role on the Mender Server.

Default: `15`</br>
Override with the Mender Server environment variable: `USERADM_LIMIT_PERMISSION_SETS_PER_ROLE`
