This page describes how to install the Mender client in an existing Linux system. Installing this way does not offer a full Mender integration. However, it is possible to use Update Modules and update parts of the system.

If full board integration is desired, follow the device documentation on [Yocto Project](../../devices/yocto-project) or [Debian family](../../devices/debian-family).


## Install Mender using the Debian package

A Debian package (`.deb`) is provided for convenience to install on e.g Debian, Ubuntu or Raspbian. A Mender package is provided for the following architectures:

- armhf (ARM-v6): ARM 32bit distributions, for example Raspbian for Raspberry Pi or Debian for BeagleBone.
- arm64: (ARM-v8): ARM 64bit processors, for example Debian for Asus Tinker Board
- amd64: Generic 64-bit x86 processors, the most popular among workstations

See [the downloads page](../../downloads) for links to download all package architectures. We will assume *armhf* in the following, which is the most common.


### Download the package

<!--AUTOVERSION: "cloudfront.net/%/"/mender "mender-client_%-1_armhf.deb"/mender -->
```bash
wget https://d1b0l86ne08fsf.cloudfront.net/2.3.0b1-build2/dist-packages/debian/armhf/mender-client_2.3.0b1-build2-1_armhf.deb
```

!!! The above link is for *armhf* devices, which is the most common device architecture. See [the downloads page](../../downloads) for other architectures, and also make sure to modify the references to the package in commands below.


### Option 1: Attended installation with a wizard

The Mender package comes with a wizard that will let you easily configure and
customize your installation. This option is recommended for new users.

To install and configure Mender run the following command:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-client_%-1_armhf.deb"/mender -->
```bash
sudo dpkg -i mender-client_2.3.0b1-build2-1_armhf.deb
```

After the installation wizard is completed, Mender is correctly setup on your
device and will automatically start in [managed
mode](../../architecture/overview#modes-of-operation). Your device is now ready
to authenticate with the server and start receiving updates.


### Option 2: Unattended installation

Alternatively, the package can be installed non-interactively,
suitable for scripts or other situations where no user
input is desired.

The setup is different depending on your server configuration and the most common cases
are shown below. Use `mender setup --help` to learn about all configuration options.

- Connecting to [hosted Mender](https://hosted.mender.io) using demo settings

<!--AUTOVERSION: "cloudfront.net/%/"/mender "mender-client_%-1_armhf.deb"/mender -->
```bash
DEVICE_TYPE="<INSERT YOUR DEVICE TYPE>"
TENANT_TOKEN="<INSERT YOUR TOKEN FROM https://hosted.mender.io/ui/#/settings/my-organization>"
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive dpkg -i mender-client_2.3.0b1-build2-1_armhf.deb
sudo mender setup \
            --device-type $DEVICE_TYPE \
            --hosted-mender \
            --tenant-token $TENANT_TOKEN \
            --retry-poll 30 \
            --update-poll 5 \
            --inventory-poll 5
sudo systemctl restart mender-client
```

- Connecting to a demo server using demo settings

<!--AUTOVERSION: "cloudfront.net/%/"/mender "mender-client_%-1_armhf.deb"/mender -->
```bash
DEVICE_TYPE="<INSERT YOUR DEVICE TYPE>"
SERVER_IP_ADDR="<INSERT THE IP ADDRESS OF YOUR DEMO SERVER>"
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive dpkg -i mender-client_2.3.0b1-build2-1_armhf.deb
sudo mender setup \
            --device-type $DEVICE_TYPE \
            --demo \
            --server-ip $SERVER_IP_ADDR
sudo systemctl restart mender-client
```

- Connecting to an [Enterprise](https://mender.io/products/mender-enterprise) server

<!--AUTOVERSION: "cloudfront.net/%/"/mender "mender-client_%-1_armhf.deb"/mender -->
```bash
DEVICE_TYPE="<INSERT YOUR DEVICE TYPE>"
SERVER_URL="<INSERT YOUR ENTERPRISE SERVER URL>"
TENANT_TOKEN="<INSERT YOUR TOKEN FROM YOUR ENTERPRISE SERVER>"
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive dpkg -i mender-client_2.3.0b1-build2-1_armhf.deb
sudo mender setup \
            --device-type $DEVICE_TYPE \
            --server-url $SERVER_URL \
            --server-cert="" \
            --tenant-token $TENANT_TOKEN \
            --retry-poll 30 \
            --update-poll 5 \
            --inventory-poll 5
sudo systemctl restart mender-client
```

## Install from source

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender/tree/%#installing-from-source"/mender -->
As an alternative to using a Debian package, it is possible to install the Mender client from source by following the guidelines outlined in the [README.md](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/tree/2.3.0b1-build2#installing-from-source) of the Mender client source repository.


## Additional information

! There are security implications to connecting a client and server for the first time, also known as *bootstrapping*. If a client and server have not exchanged any information in advance, they need to accept each other on trust this first time, with the risk that the information the other party presents is spoofed. To mitigate this risk, the Mender client preinstalls the TLS certificate of the server when it is provisioned, as part of the Yocto Project image build. So it is not possible for a rogue server to intercept the connection from a client or pretend to be a different server, assuming server's private TLS key is securely managed. A rogue device can still spoof the information it sends to the server in order to be authorized, and this is why Mender asks you to make the authorization decision. However, the risk of letting the server manage a rogue device is much lower than the risk of a rogue server managing devices.
