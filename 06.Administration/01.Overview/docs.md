Mender backend is composed of a number of microservices, each implementing a
small, well defined piece of functionality.

The integration environment, previously used
in [Create a test environment](../../getting-started/create-a-test-environment)
chapter, brings together the following services:

- [Mender Device Admission Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deviceadm?target=_blank)
- [Mender Device Authentication Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deviceauth?target=_blank)
- [Mender Deployment Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deployments?target=_blank)
- [Mender Device Inventory Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/inventory?target=_blank)
- [Mender User Administration Service](https://github.com/mendersoftware/useradm?target=_blank)
- [Mender API Gateway](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender-api-gateway-docker?target=_blank)
- [Minio](https://www.minio.io/?target=_blank) object storage
- Storage service proxy based on [OpenResty](https://openresty.org/en/?target=_blank)

Services are delivered in form of Docker images, available from
official [Mender Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/mendersoftware/?target=_blank).
When required, each service can be built directly from its source code. Consult
respective repositories for build instructions.

While it is possible to `docker pull` individual images and start containers
manually,
the [integration repository](https://github.com/mendersoftware/integration?target=_blank)
provides a convenient setup based on Docker Compose tool. The
`docker-compose.yml` file describes the following setup:
