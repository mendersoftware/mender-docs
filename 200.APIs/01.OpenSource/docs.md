## Mender Open Source APIs


### REST

The Mender API is a RESTful API. This means that the API is designed to allow 
you to get, create, update, & delete objects with the HTTP verbs GET, POST, 
PUT, PATCH, & DELETE. The APIs make use of CORS (cross-origin-request) which 
also uses the OPTIONS request method.
