This section provides an overview of the variables that `mender-convert` uses
during the conversion process.

You can override any option specified here by providing your own configuration
file using the '--config' argument.



#### `IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR`

> Value: 1.5 (default)

This factor is multiplied by the used space value for the generated rootfs, and
if the result is larger than `IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE + IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE`, it
will be used as the size of the rootfs instead of the other two variables.

The actual free space will usually be lower than requested. See comment for
[`IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE`](#image_rootfs_extra_space).

This variable directly mirrors the variable from the Yocto Project, which is
why it is missing a "MENDER_" prefix.



#### `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE`

> Value: 0 (default)

The amount of extra free space requested on the rootfs, in KiB. This is added to
the value of `IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE`. The size is further modified by
`IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR`.

Note that due to reserved space for the root user on the filesystem, "df" may
report a significantly lower number than requested. A more accurate number can
be fetched using for example `dumpe2fs` and looking for the `Free blocks` field,
but even this value is usually going to be lower than requested due to meta data
on the filesystem.

This variable directly mirrors the variable from the Yocto Project, which is why
it is missing a "MENDER_" prefix.



#### `IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE`

> Value: 0 (default)

The size of each of the two rootfs filesystems, in KiB. If this is 0,
mender-convert will use the size of the filesystem content as a basis. If the
value is -1, mender-convert will use the maximum size that will fit inside the
created partition. The size is further modified by `IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE`
and `IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR`.

This variable directly mirrors the variable from the Yocto Project, which is why
it is missing a "MENDER_" prefix.



#### `MENDER_ARTIFACT_COMPRESSION`

> Values: gzip(default)/lzma/zstd_fast/zstd_fastest/zstd_better/zstd_best/none

The compression algorithm to use when generating the Artifact. In general LZMA
will produce a smaller Mender Artifact (2-3x) but will significantly increase
time spent generating the Mender Artifact (10x), compared to gzip.

Zstd provides different compression levels, and can achieve comparable
compression ratios to both gzip and LZMA, at faster compression and
decompression throughput. `zstd_fast` is the default.
See https://engineering.fb.com/2018/12/19/core-data/zstandard for details.



#### `MENDER_ARTIFACT_NAME`

> Value: &lt;release-name&gt;

Explicitly set the name of the generated update Artifact. Required for the
conversion to succeed. However, should be specified on the command line, and not
in the configuration.


#### `MENDER_BOOT_PART`

> Value:

This option allows fine grained control of the boot partition device path and overrides `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE` and `MENDER_BOOT_PART_NUMBER` settings. If part-uuid is used then you will need to also enable `MENDER_ENABLE_PARTUUID`

Examples: 
```
/dev/sda1
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-f37c-408b-be2c-3ef419866620
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-01
```


#### `MENDER_BOOT_PART_MOUNT_LOCATION`

> Value: `/boot/efi` / `/uboot` (default)

Path to mount the boot partition in the root filesystem.

In order to access the boot partition from the running system,
it needs to be mounted to a defined directory location.
By default, this is
- `/boot/efi`: for GRUB-EFI based integrations (can be omitted if `MENDER_GRUB_EFI_INTEGRATION=y`)
- `/uboot`: for all other integrations

Example:
```
MENDER_BOOT_PART_MOUNT_LOCATION = "/boot/firmware"
```

#### `MENDER_BOOT_PART_NUMBER`

> Value: 1 (default) 

Set the default index for the boot partition.


#### `MENDER_BOOT_PART_SIZE_MB`

> Value: 40 (default)

The size of the boot partition.


#### `MENDER_CLIENT_INSTALL`

> Value: y(default)/n

Install the Mender Client.

#### `MENDER_CLIENT_VERSION`

<!--AUTOVERSION: "/%/"/ignore-->
> Value: auto(default)/latest/master/&lt;version&gt;

The version of the Mender Client to include in the update.


#### `MENDER_ADDON_CONNECT_INSTALL`

> Value: y/n(default)

Install the Mender Connect add-on.


#### `MENDER_ADDON_CONNECT_VERSION`

<!--AUTOVERSION: "/%/"/ignore-->
> Value: latest(default)/master/&lt;version&gt;

The version of the Mender Connect add-on to include in the update.


#### `MENDER_ADDON_CONFIGURE_INSTALL`

> Value: y/n(default)

Install the Mender Configure add-on.


#### `MENDER_ADDON_CONFIGURE_VERSION`

<!--AUTOVERSION: "/%/"/ignore-->
> Value: latest(default)/master/&lt;version&gt;

The version of the Mender Configure add-on to include in the update.

### `MENDER_INSTALL_INPUT_PACKAGES_PATH

> Value: input/deb(default)

Directory containing deb packages to be installed in the image


### `MENDER_INSTALL_INPUT_PACKAGES`

> Value: y/n(default)

Install deb packages located in MENDER_INSTALL_INPUT_PACKAGES_PATH


#### `MENDER_COMPRESS_DISK_IMAGE`

> Values: gzip/lzma/none

This is useful when you have large disk images, compressing them makes it easier
to transfer them between a build server and a local machine, and saves space.

The default behavior is to deduce it from the input image. For an uncompressed
input image, the default value will be `none`. For a compressed image, the default
value will be `lzma` or `gzip`, depending on the input image compression.


#### `MENDER_DATA_PART`

> Value:

This option allows fine grained control of the data partition device path and overrides `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE` and `MENDER_DATA_PART_NUMBER` settings. If part-uuid is used then you will need to also enable `MENDER_ENABLE_PARTUUID`

Examples: 
```
/dev/sda4
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-f37c-408b-be2c-3ef419866623
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-04
```


#### `MENDER_DATA_PART_FSTAB_OPTS`

> Values: defaults/&lt;fstab specific options&gt;

Options passed on to fstab.



#### `MENDER_DATA_PART_GROWFS`

> Values: y(default)/n

Enable/Disable automatically growing the filesystem to fill the physical storage device.


#### `MENDER_DATA_PART_NUMBER`

> Value: 4 (default)

Set the index of the data partition.


#### `MENDER_DATA_PART_SIZE_MB`

> Value: 128 (default)

The size of the Mender data partition.


#### `MENDER_DEVICE_TYPE`

> Value: &lt;device-type&gt;

Set the device type specified by the Artifact. If left empty it will default to
the value of '/etc/hostname'.


#### `MENDER_ENABLE_PARTUUID`

> Values: y/n(default)

This option enables the use of partuuid's as partition block device references. The variables `MENDER_BOOT_PART`, `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_A`, `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_B` and `MENDER_DATA_PART` should also be set in conjunction with this variable to ensure reproducible builds with the same part-uuids.


#### `MENDER_ENABLE_SYSTEMD`

> Values: y(default)/n

If you want the Mender Client to operate in managed mode and connect to a
server, then this should be enabled. If you are not interested connecting to a
server and will only be running standalone mode updates, then you can safely
disable this.


#### `MENDER_GITHUB_ORG`

> Value: https://github.com/mendersoftware (default)

The URL prefix for looking up the mendersoftware dependencies.


#### `MENDER_KERNEL_DEVICETREE`

> Value: kernel.dtb (default)

Set the name of the kernel devicetree file.


#### `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT`

> Value: 8388608 ( 8MB, default)

The partition alignment expressed in bytes.


#### `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_A`

> Value:

This option allows fine grained control of the first (A) rootfs partition device path and overrides `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE` and `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_A_NUMBER` settings. If part-uuid is used then you will need to also enable `MENDER_ENABLE_PARTUUID`

Examples: 
```
/dev/sda2
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-f37c-408b-be2c-3ef419866621
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-02
```


#### `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_A_NUMBER`

> Value: 2 (default)

Set the default index of the rootfs part-A partition.


#### `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_B`

> Value:

This option allows fine grained control of the first (B) rootfs partition device path and overrides `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE` and `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_B_NUMBER` settings. If part-uuid is used then you will need to also enable `MENDER_ENABLE_PARTUUID`

Examples: 
```
/dev/sda3
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-f37c-408b-be2c-3ef419866622
/dev/disk/by-partuuid/26445670-03
```


#### `MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_B_NUMBER`

> Value: 3 (default)

Set the default index of the rootfs part-B partition.


#### `MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE`

> Value: /dev/mmcblk0p (default)

Set the device file corresponding to the root filesystem partitions.


#### `MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB`

> Value: 8192 (default)

Total size of the physical storage medium that mender partitioned images will be
written to, expressed in MiB. The size of rootfs partition will be calculated
automatically by subtracting the sizes of boot (see
[MENDER_BOOT_PART_SIZE_MB](#mender_boot_part_size_mb)) and data partitions (see
[MENDER_DATA_PART_SIZE_MB](#mender_data_part_size_mb)). Default value is `8192`.


#### `MENDER_SPARSE_IMAGE`

> Value: y/n(default)

Mender sparse image file generation
By default, mender-convert writes the entire image. When enabled (value: y), mender-convert attempts to avoid allocating empty spaces within the image. This can result in the created image using less space on the storage medium while maintaining the expected size.

However, some tools may not handle sparse files correctly.


#### `MENDER_STORAGE_URL`

> Value: https://downloads.mender.io (default)

The source of the binaries employed by the `Mender-convert` tool.


#### `MENDER_USE_BMAP`

> Values: y/n (default)

Enable/Disable the usage of bmap index in the generated image.
