This document will show how *standalone* deployments work with Mender,
where no Mender Server is used and the deployments are triggered at the
device, either manually in the terminal or by custom scripts. This can be useful in order
to deploy updates to devices which do not have network connectivity or
are updated through external storage like a USB stick.

For an explanation of the difference between *managed* and *standalone* deployments, please see
[Modes of operation](../../02.Overview/01.Introduction/docs.md#client-modes-of-operation).

!!! Note that [state scripts](../../07.Artifact-creation/04.State-scripts/docs.md) work slightly differently in standalone mode, see [state scripts and standalone mode](../../07.Artifact-creation/04.State-scripts/docs.md#standalone-mode) for more information.

## Setting Mender up for standalone mode

If you would like to run Mender in *standalone* mode, you
must make sure that the `mender-updated` service isn't running. If you want to check if Mender is running as a daemon, you can try the following command:
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo systemctl status mender-updated
● mender-updated.service - Mender OTA update service
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/mender-updated.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Thu 2020-07-23 03:24:54 BST; 16h ago
 Main PID: 320 (mender)
    Tasks: 9 (limit: 1012)
   Memory: 7.5M
   CGroup: /system.slice/mender-updated.service
           └─320 /usr/bin/mender-update daemon
```

<!--AUTOVERSION: "Before `mender-update` %"/ignore-->
!!! Before `mender-update` 4.0.0, the service was called `mender-client`. Please replace `mender-updated` with `mender-client` in the snippets if you are using such a version.

The status reported as active indicates that in order to use standalone mode you have to stop and disable Mender running as a daemon.
```bash
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo systemctl stop mender-updated
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo systemctl disable mender-updated
pi@raspberrypi:~$ sudo systemctl mask mender-updated
```


## Deploy an Artifact to a device

To deploy the new Artifact to your device, run the following command in the
device terminal:

```bash
mender-update install <URI>
```

<!--AUTOVERSION: "Before `mender-update` %"/ignore-->
!!! Before `mender-update` 4.0.0, the command was just called `mender`. Please replace `mender-update` with `mender` in the snippet above if you are using such a version. This applies to the snippets below as well.

`<URI>` can be any type of file-based storage or an HTTP/HTTPS URL.
For example, if you are updating from a USB stick, you could use `/mnt/usb1/release1.mender`.
To use HTTPS, simply replace it with a URL like `https://fileserver.example.com/mender/release1.mender`.

!!! If you are doing an Operating System update, now run the `reboot` command to boot into the new filesystem.

## Make the deployment permanent

If you are happy with the deployment, you can make it permanent by running the following command in your device terminal:

```bash
mender-update commit
```

By running this command, Mender will mark the update as successful and permanent.

To deploy another update, simply run `mender-update install <URI>` again, then reboot and commit.
