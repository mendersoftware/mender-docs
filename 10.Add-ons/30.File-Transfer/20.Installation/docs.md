to the below sections for the details:
* [mender-convert integration](../../../04.Operating-System-updates-Debian-family/99.Variables/docs.md#mender_addon_connect_install) for installation in the existing images
* [Yocto projects](../../../05.Operating-System-updates-Yocto-Project/05.Customize-Mender/docs.md#mender-connect) for the installation in a Yocto Project environment
* [installation with a deb](../../../11.Downloads/docs.md#remote-terminal-add-on) for the installation from the Debian package
