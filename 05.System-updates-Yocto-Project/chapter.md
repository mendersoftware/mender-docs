# System updates: Yocto Project

Mender provides full integration with the [Yocto
Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org?target=_blank) build system.

Mender's meta layer, [meta-mender](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender?target=_blank), has
several branches that map to given releases of the Yocto Project. However, note that Mender is
tested and maintained against the **latest release branch of the Yocto Project** only. Older
branches for the Yocto Project are still kept in
[meta-mender](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender?target=_blank), but they might not work
seamlessly as they are not continuously tested by Mender. If you need support for older branches we
recommend subscribing to [Mender commercial software
support](https://mender.io/support-and-services/software-support?target=_blank).
