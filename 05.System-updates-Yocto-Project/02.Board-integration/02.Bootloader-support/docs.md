title: Bootloader support

This section describes the support level of the two bootloaders that Mender supports, [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software//?target=_blank) and [U-Boot](http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot?target=_blank).

By default, Mender uses GRUB to boot, and this is the recommended bootloader to use, even on platforms that ordinarily use U-Boot. However, U-Boot can be used in cases where using GRUB is not possible or unsuccessful.

!!! On platforms using [Raw flash](../03.Raw-flash/docs.md) (UBI), it is only possible to use U-Boot.

The main technical reason for using GRUB rather than U-Boot is that GRUB requires no patching to work with Mender, whereas U-Boot does. For most users this will be the path of least resistance.

Please see the sub sections for [GRUB](./01.GRUB/docs.md) and [U-Boot](./02.U-Boot/docs.md) for more details.

## Compatibility

Below is a table listing the bootloader support using various device types. All versions of the Mender client software will work with either of the two bootloaders.
