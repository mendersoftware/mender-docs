## Including state scripts in Artifacts and disk images

To include state scripts in Artifacts and images, create a new Yocto recipe that inherits `mender-state-scripts` and copies them into place in `do_compile`, using the [${MENDER_STATE_SCRIPTS_DIR}](../../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project/99.Variables/docs.md#mender_state_scripts_dir) variable. This works for both [root file system and Artifact scripts](../../../06.Artifact-creation/04.State-scripts/docs.md#root-file-system-and-Artifact-scripts).

<!--AUTOVERSION: "meta-mender/tree/%"/meta-mender-->
Take a look at the [example-state-scripts](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender/tree/master/meta-mender-demo/recipes-mender/example-state-scripts?target=_blank) recipe to get started.

!! If you add or remove a recipe containing state scripts to a build, you need to clear the `tmp` directory of the Yocto build before building a new image. An alternative is to call `bitbake -c clean <recipe>` with the affected recipe, but the first method is recommended since it will cover all cases, regardless of recipe name. Merely changing a recipe does not require this step.
