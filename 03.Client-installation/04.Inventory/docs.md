## Basic rules for inventory attributes gathering

Periodically, the Mender client runs every executable file possessing
the `mender-inventory-` prefix from `/usr/share/mender/inventory` directory.
Then it parses each line read from the standard output of the script according
to the following format:

```
name0=value0\n
.
.
nameN=valueN\n
```
Then the client publishes the attributes via [device inventory service API calls](../../200.APIs/01.Open-source/01.Device-APIs/02.Device-inventory#device-attributes-patch),
namely by issuing **PATCH** _/device/attributes_.

### Lists of values

The client merges attributes appearing multiple times into lists.
For example, the following output from the inventory executable:

```
interface=eth0
ip_address_eth0=192.168.1.1
interface=wlan0
ip_address_wlan0=172.27.1.1
```

will lead to the following attributes:

```
interface = [eth0, wlan0]
ip_address_eth0 = 192.168.1.1
ip_address_wlan0 = 172.27.1.1
```

### Special characters

You cannot use literal new line character in attribute names or values.
To support new lines or other special characters, use URL-style encoding.
For instance, if you want to encode:
```
multilinekey=value1\nvalue0
```
you have to use:
```
multilinekey=value1%0Avalue0
```

## Example inventory script

Let's assume you want to create a group of devices called "LinuxDevicesInKrakow".
To achieve this, obviously we need to collect the information from the device about
its localization and deliver it to the server. Your best choice to do it in a portable
manner, is to use inventory attribute scripts. The following listing shows an
example of such script. It gathers information on the localization from the network.

<!--AUTOVERSION: "curl/%"/ignore-->
```bash
#!/bin/sh
#
# The example script collects geo localization information
#
function err() {
 local rc=$1

 shift
 echo "${0}: $*" >&2
 exit $rc
}

# find the ip address
ip=`wget -qO /dev/stdout --header "Content-Type: text/plain;" \
     --header 'Host: ifconfig.io' --header 'User-Agent: curl/7.67.0' \
     --header 'Accept: */*' ifconfig.io | tail -1`

[ -n "${ip}" ] || err 2 "Unable to get the IP address from ifconfig.io"

# get the information, see https://www.ipvigilante.com/api-developer-docs/
geo=`wget -qO /dev/stdout https://ipvigilante.com/csv/${ip} 2>/dev/null`

[ -n "${geo}" ] || err 3 "Unable to get the geolocalization data from ipvigilante.com"

# the names of the attributes holding the localization data can be configured here
ATTR_NAME_IP="a-ip"
ATTR_NAME_CONTINENT="a-continent"
ATTR_NAME_COUNTRY="a-country"
ATTR_NAME_CITY="a-city"

echo "${geo}" | awk -v ip="${ATTR_NAME_IP}" -v continent="${ATTR_NAME_CONTINENT}" \
    -v country="${ATTR_NAME_COUNTRY}" -v city="${ATTR_NAME_CITY}" -F',' \
    ' length($NF) == 0 { exit(4) }
      { printf("%s=%s\n%s=%s\n%s=%s\n%s=%s\n",ip,$1,continent,$2,country,$3,city,$6) }
    '
```

The above example first gets the public source ip address of the IP packets originating
from the device, then calls an endpoint to get the geo localization data, parses
the response data, and finally prints it to standard output
in the format "attribute_name=attribute_value". You should store this script
in the `/usr/share/mender/inventory`
directory, giving it a name, e.g.: `mender-inventory-geo.sh` and executable permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 /usr/share/mender/inventory/mender-inventory-geo.sh
```
Example output of the above script can look like this:
```
a-ip=x.x.x.x
a-continent=Europe
a-country=Poland
a-city=Krakow
```

You can find some more useful scripts in [https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/support](https://github.com/mendersoftware/mender/tree/master/support) directory.

## Default inventory

By default, and without any inventory scripts in, the Mender client sends the following attributes:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "client version | \"%\""/mender-->
| name | meaning | example value |
|:----:|:-------:|:-------------:|
| `device_type`  | type of the device | "raspberrypi4" |
| `artifact_name` | name of the currently installed artifact | "release-v1" |
| `mender_client_version` | client version | "2.2.0" |

## Final remarks
You should not use inventory attributes to uniquely identify a device. They are
a feature to allow you to store useful information, in a well-defined format,
used for search, sorting and filtering.
