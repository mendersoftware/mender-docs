This section provides a reference of variables Mender use during the Yocto Project build process.
The variables are either specific to- and defined by Mender, as shown by the `MENDER_` prefix, or [defined by the Yocto Project](http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.2/ref-manual/ref-manual.html?target=_blank#ref-variables-glos) and used by Mender.


#### IMAGE_FSTYPES

Influences which file system type Mender will build for the rootfs partitions in the `.sdimg` file. Mender will pick the **first** of the file system types ext2/ext3/ext4 listed in this variable as the file system for rootfs in the generated `.sdimg` file. See [File system types](../../devices/partition-layout#file-system-types) for more information.


#### IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE

The size of the generated rootfs. This will be the size that is shipped in a `.mender` update. This variable is a standard Yocto Project variable and is influenced by several other factors. See [the Yocto Project documentation](http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.2/ref-manual/ref-manual.html?target=_blank#var-IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE) for more information.

Note that this variable has no effect when generating an SD card image (`sdimg`), since in that case the size is determined automatically. See  [`MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB`](#mender_storage_total_size_mb) for more information.


#### MENDER_ARTIFACT_NAME

The name of the image or update that will be built. This is what the device will report that it is running, and different updates must have different names. This variable must be defined or the build will fail.


#### MENDER_BOOT_PART

The partition Mender uses as the boot partition. See [More detailed storage configuration](../../devices/partition-layout#more-detailed-storage-configuration) for more information.


#### MENDER_BOOT_PART_SIZE_MB

The size of the boot partition in the generated `.sdimg` file. See [Configuring the partition sizes](../../devices/partition-layout#configuring-the-partition-sizes) for more information.


#### MENDER_DATA_PART

The partition Mender uses as the persistent data partition. See [More detailed storage configuration](../../devices/partition-layout#more-detailed-storage-configuration) for more information.


#### MENDER_DATA_PART_SIZE_MB

The size of the persistent data partition in the generated `.sdimg` file. See [Configuring the partition sizes](../../devices/partition-layout#configuring-the-partition-sizes) for more information.


#### MENDER_DEMO_HOST_IP_ADDRESS

As the name indicates, this variable is only relevant if you are building Mender with the `meta-mender-demo` layer. If set to an IP address, this variable sets the hostname resolution of the API gateway and the storage proxy (`docker.mender.io` and `s3.docker.mender.io`) to that address. The default is empty, which reverts to querying DNS (but note that the Docker setup comes with its own DNS server).


#### MENDER_DEVICE_TYPE

A string that defines the type of device this image will be installed on. This variable is only relevant when building a complete partitioned image (`.sdimg` suffix). Once a device is flashed with this, it will not change, even if the device is updated.

It defaults to the value of `${MACHINE}`.


#### MENDER_DEVICE_TYPES_COMPATIBLE

A space separated string of device types that determine which types of devices this update is suitable for. This complements the `MENDER_DEVICE_TYPE` variable, and is only relevant when building a `.mender` update, not when building a `.sdimg` partitioned image.

It defaults to the value of `${MACHINE}`.


#### MENDER_PARTITIONING_OVERHEAD_MB

A rough estimate of space lost due to partition alignment, expressed in MB. The
`.sdimg` build process will calculate that automatically using a simple
heuristic: `4 * MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT_MB` (accounts for boot partition, two
rootfs partitions and a data partition).


#### MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT_MB

Alignment of partitions used when building `.sdimg` image, expressed in MB.
Default value is `8`.


#### MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_A

The partition Mender uses as the first (A) rootfs partition. See [More detailed storage configuration](../../devices/partition-layout#more-detailed-storage-configuration) for more information.


#### MENDER_ROOTFS_PART_B

The partition Mender uses as the second (B) rootfs partition. See [More detailed storage configuration](../../devices/partition-layout#more-detailed-storage-configuration) for more information.


#### MENDER_STORAGE_DEVICE

The storage device holding all partitions (rootfs, boot, data) used by Mender. See [Configuring storage](../../devices/partition-layout#configuring-storage) for more information.


#### MENDER_STORAGE_TOTAL_SIZE_MB

Total size of the medium that mender `.sdimg` will be written to, expressed in
MB. The size of rootfs partition will be calculated automatically by subtracting
the sizes of boot (see [MENDER_BOOT_PART_SIZE_MB](#mender_boot_part_size_mb))
and data partitions (see [MENDER_DATA_PART_SIZE_MB](#mender_data_part_size_mb))
along with some predefined overhead
(see [MENDER_PARTITIONING_OVERHEAD_MB](#mender_partitioning_overhead_mb))).
Default value is `1024`.


#### MENDER_UBOOT_ENV_STORAGE_DEVICE_OFFSET

Specifies the offset from the start of the raw block storage where the U-Boot
environment should be stored, expressed in bytes. The default is equal to
`MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT_MB` (converted to bytes), and if the value is
overridden, it must also be aligned to `MENDER_PARTITION_ALIGNMENT_MB`.


#### MENDER_UBOOT_STORAGE_DEVICE

The storage device, as referred to by U-Boot (e.g. `1`). This variable can be used in cases where the Linux kernel and U-Boot refer to the same device with different names. See [U-Boot and the Linux kernel do not agree about the indexes of storage devices](../../troubleshooting/yocto-project-build#u-boot-and-the-linux-kernel-do-not-agree-about-the-indexes-of-st) for more information.


#### MENDER_UBOOT_STORAGE_INTERFACE

The storage interface, as referred to by U-Boot (e.g. `mmc`). This variable can be used in cases where the Linux kernel and U-Boot refer to the same device with different names. See [U-Boot and the Linux kernel do not agree about the indexes of storage devices](../../troubleshooting/yocto-project-build#u-boot-and-the-linux-kernel-do-not-agree-about-the-indexes-of-st) for more information.


#### SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE_pn-mender

Controls whether to run Mender as a systemd service. See [Modes of operations](../../architecture/overview#modes-of-operation) and [Image configuration](../../artifacts/image-configuration) for more information.
