title: Modifying a disk image

When provisioning a device, it is useful to modify the disk image (`.sdimg`)
before flashing it to SD cards in order to edit necessary configurations.
In order to do this we can discover the partition offsets within the disk image
and mount the individual partition file systems based on these offsets.

In the example below we will use a BeagleBone Black disk image (`mender-beaglebone.sdimg`),
but the procedure is the same for all disk images.

We start off by looking at information about the image with `fdisk`:

```bash
fdisk -l -u mender-beaglebone.sdimg
```

The output should look similar to the following:

```
Disk mender-beaglebone.sdimg: 384 MiB, 402653184 bytes, 786432 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x7dea8cfc

Device                   Boot  Start    End Sectors  Size Id Type
mender-beaglebone.sdimg1 *     49152  81919   32768   16M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
mender-beaglebone.sdimg2       81920 294911  212992  104M 83 Linux
mender-beaglebone.sdimg3      294912 507903  212992  104M 83 Linux
mender-beaglebone.sdimg4      524287 786431  262145  128M  f W95 Ext'd (LBA)
mender-beaglebone.sdimg5      524288 786431  262144  128M 83 Linux

```

In this example there are four partitions (plus an extended partition). Please see
[Partition layout](../../devices/partition-layout) for a description of the
partitions Mender uses. The two Linux partitions in the middle, at device
`.sdimg2` and `.sdimg3`, are the two rootfs partitions.

First, we need to know the *sector size*. This is shown by the third line of the output,
in bold below:

> Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = **512** bytes

The second piece of information we need is the *start sector* of the partition we want to mount.
This is the second column in the output from `fdisk`. The start sector is shown in bold below for
our two rootfs partitions:

> mender-beaglebone.sdimg2       **81920** 294911  212992  104M 83 Linux  
> mender-beaglebone.sdimg3      **294912** 507903  212992  104M 83 Linux  

In order to mount a partition we simply multiply the sector size and the start sector
and pass that to `mount`. You can use `bash` to do this calculation for you.
So in order to mount both the rootfs partitions in our example, we can run the following commands:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mnt/rootfs1 && sudo mkdir /mnt/rootfs2
```

```bash
sudo mount -o loop,offset=$((512*81920)) mender-beaglebone.sdimg /mnt/rootfs1
```

```bash
sudo mount -o loop,offset=$((512*294912)) mender-beaglebone.sdimg /mnt/rootfs2
```

Now you can modify the rootfs file systems in the paths `/mnt/rootfs1` and `/mnt/rootfs2`.
When finished, please remember to unmount so that the changes are written back to the
disk image, like the following:

```bash
sudo umount /mnt/rootfs1 && sudo umount /mnt/rootfs2
```

Optionally, you can also remove the created directories:

```bash
sudo rmdir /mnt/rootfs1 && sudo rmdir /mnt/rootfs2
```
