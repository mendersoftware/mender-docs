The Mender Client has the ability to run pre- and postinstall scripts, before and after it writes the root file system. However, Mender state scripts are more general and useful than pre/postinstall scripts because they can be run between *any* state transition, not just (before/after) the install state. For some examples of usage, see [example use cases](#example-use-cases).


## The nine states

Starting with the Mender Client version 1.2, support is available for scripts to be run before and after nine different states:

* **Idle**: this is a state where no communication with the server is needed nor is there any update in progress
* **Sync**: communication with the server is needed (currently while checking if there is an update for the given device and when inventory data is sent to server)
* **Download**: there is an update for the given device and a new image is downloaded and written (i.e. streamed) to the inactive rootfs partition
* **ArtifactInstall**: swapping of active and inactive partitions after the download and writing is completed
* **ArtifactReboot**: after the update is installed we need to reboot the device to apply the new image. The Enter actions run before the reboot; the Leave actions run after.
* **ArtifactCommit**: device is up and running after rebooting with the new image, and the commit makes the update persistent
* **ArtifactRollback**: if the new update is broken and we need to go back to the previous one
* **ArtifactRollbackReboot**: if we need to reboot the device after performing rollback
* **ArtifactFailure**: if any of the "Artifact" states are failing, the device enters and executes this state. This state always runs after the ArtifactRollback and ArtifactRollbackReboot states.

State scripts can either be run as we transition into a state; "Enter", or out from a state, "Leave". Most of the states also have an "Error" transition which is run when some error occurs while executing any action inside the given state (including execution of Enter and Leave scripts).


## Root file system and Artifact scripts

There are two types of the state scripts: root file system and Artifact. The root file systems scripts are stored as a part of the current root file system. The default location
for those scripts is `/etc/mender/scripts`.
The Artifact scripts are part of the Artifact and are delivered to the Client inside the Artifact. All the Artifact scripts are prefixed with `Artifact`.

The reason for having both root file system and Artifact scripts is related to the fact that some scripts must run before the Client downloads the Artifact and as such can not be delivered with the Artifact. Those scripts are Idle, Sync and Download. Therefore it is important to remember that when deploying a new update, all scripts will be run from the currently installed Artifact (root file system) until ArtifactInstall, at which point the scripts from the new Artifact will take over.


## Transitions and ordering

State scripts are run by the Mender Client after reaching a given state. Before entering the new state the Enter scripts are run. After all the actions belonging to the given state are executed, the Leave scripts are run. For most of the states, if some error occurs while executing either an Enter or a Leave script, or some action inside the state (like installing a new artifact which is broken and therefore installation is failing) the corresponding Error scripts are executed.
The exceptions are Idle, Sync, ArtifactRollback, ArtifactRollbackReboot, ArtifactFailure and Leave script for ArtifactCommit. The reason for ignoring errors and not calling Error scripts is either that the state is already an error state, such as for example ArtifactRollback, or there is no meaningful action that can be taken in the event of an error, such as for Idle or ArtifactCommit.Leave (it is too late to roll back after a commit).

There can be more than one script for a given state. Each script contains an ordering number as a part of the naming convention, which determines when it is run:

```
<STATE_NAME>_<ACTION>_<ORDERING_NUMBER>_<OPTIONAL_DESCRIPTION>
```

For example, `Download_Enter_05_wifi-driver` and `Download_Enter_10_ask-user` are both run before the `Download` state, and the `wifi-driver` script would run before the `ask-user` script. The ordering between the states depends on the outcome of the states run, please see [state transition ordering](#state-transition-ordering) for the most common cases.

**There are no arguments passed to the scripts.**
**If a script returns 0 Mender proceeds, but if it returns 1 the update is aborted and rolled back. All other return codes are reserved for future use by Mender and should not be used.**

## Retry-later functionality

State scripts are allowed to return a specific error code, in order to rerun at a later time. Thus if a script returns the error code '21', the client will sleep for a default time of one minute, or for a user-specified interval 'StateScriptRetryTimeoutSeconds', which can be set in the mender config. Also note that scripts are not allowed to retry infinitely. Either a standard max window of thirty minutes is allocated to each script, or this can be configured manually by using the mender config variable 'StateScriptRetryIntervalSeconds'.


## Example use cases

Mender users will probably come up with a lot of interesting use cases for state scripts, and we will cover some well-known ones below for inspiration.

#### Application data migration
In this case, application data like a user profile is stored in an SQLite database and a new column need to be added before starting the new version of the application. This can be achieved by adding a state script to `ArtifactReboot_Enter` (that would run after writing the new rootfs, but before rebooting). This script can then do the necessary migrations on the data partition before the new version of the application is brought up after the reboot.


#### Update confirmation by end user
For many devices with a display that interacts with an end user, it is desirable to ask the user before applying the update. You have probably seen this on a smartphone, where it will ask you if you want to update to the latest release of Android or iOS and it only starts after you hit "Apply".

Mender state scripts enable this use case with a script written to create the dialog box on the UI framework used. The script will simply wait for user input, and Mender will wait with the update process while waiting for the script to finish. Depending on what the user selects, the script can return 0 (proceed) or 1 (stop). This script can be run in the `Download_Enter` state, for example.

Make sure to [increase the default timeout for state scripts](../../client-configuration/configuration-file/configuration-options#statescripttimeoutseconds) to enable this use case.


#### Custom sanity checks after the update is installed
Mender already automatically rolls back an update if it can not reach the Mender Server after the update is installed, in order to ensure *another* update can be deployed.

Scripts in `ArtifactCommit_Enter` can do additional sanity checks to make sure that the device and applications are working as expected. For example, is the UI application running and responding within a given amount of time? If not, then the script can simply return 1 and Mender will roll back the update.


#### Enable network connectivity

In order to save power and bandwidth, network connectivity may not be enabled by default on the device, so you want to selectively enable it when needed.

A state script in `Sync_Enter` can enable network connectivity. You could also enable more powerful network connectivity, such as Wi-Fi, with a state script in `Download_Enter`. If the network is not brought up by default on reboot, you should also enable network in `Reboot_Leave`.

!!! Note that the `Sync_Enter` transition can be reached quite frequently, depending on the [polling intervals](../../client-configuration/configuration-file/polling-intervals). The Mender Client also requires network in several following states of the update process to report progress to the Mender Server (unless you use [standalone mode](../../architecture/overview#modes-of-operation)).

If you want to explicitly disable network again after Mender has finished the deployment, the only safe place to do this is in `Idle_Enter`.

## Including state scripts in Artifacts and disk images

The easiest way to have Mender run the state scripts is to create a new OpenEmbedded recipe that inherits `mender-state-scripts` and copies them into place in `do_compile`, using the [${MENDER_STATE_SCRIPTS_DIR}](../../artifacts/variables#mender_state_scripts_dir) variable.

Take a look at the [example-state-scripts](https://github.com/mendersoftware/meta-mender/tree/master/meta-mender-demo/recipes-mender/example-state-scripts) recipe to get started.


## State transition ordering

You will find state transitions for common scenarios below.


#### Normal execution without errors

1. (device boot)
2. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]
3. [Sync_Enter] Sync [Sync_Leave]
4. [Download_Enter] Download [Download_Leave]
5. [ArtifactInstall_Enter] ArtifactInstall [ArtifactInstall_Leave]
6. [ArtifactReboot_Enter] ArtifactReboot
7. (device reboot)
8. [ArtifactReboot_Leave]
9. [ArtifactCommit_Enter] ArtifactCommit [ArtifactCommit_Leave]
10. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]

Please note that scripts in `ArtifactReboot_Leave` are run *after* the device has rebooted.


#### Error while downloading the Artifact

1. (device boot)
2. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]
3. [Sync_Enter] Sync [Sync_Leave]
4. [Download_Enter] Download
5. (error while downloading)
6. [Download_Error]
7. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]

Please note that no scripts in the `Download_Leave` transition are run if the download fails. Instead, the scripts in the `Download_Error` transition are run.


#### Error while installing the update

1. (device boot)
2. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]
3. [Sync_Enter] Sync [Sync_Leave]
4. [Download_Enter] Download [Download_Leave]
5. [ArtifactInstall_Enter] ArtifactInstall
6. (error while installing)
7. [ArtifactInstall_Error]
8. [ArtifactFailure_Enter] ArtifactFailure [ArtifactFailure_Leave]
9. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]

In case any of the `Artifact` scripts fail, an additional `ArtifactFailure` state is entered and the corresponding Enter and Leave scripts are run. Please also note that *there is no* `ArtifactFailure_Error` state transition and if any error occurs while executing actions inside the `ArtifactFailure` state, the scripts in the `ArtifactFailure_Leave` transition will run and an appropriate error path will be executed.


#### Error while committing an update

1. (device boot)
2. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]
3. [Sync_Enter] Sync [Sync_Leave]
4. [Download_Enter] Download [Download_Leave]
5. [ArtifactInstall_Enter] ArtifactInstall [ArtifactInstall_Leave]
6. [ArtifactReboot_Enter] ArtifactReboot
7. (device reboot)
8. [ArtifactReboot_Leave]
9. [ArtifactCommit_Enter] ArtifactCommit
10. (error while committing)
11. [ArtifactCommit_Error]
12. [ArtifactFailure_Enter] ArtifactFailure [ArtifactFailure_Leave]
13. [ArtifactRollback_Enter] ArtifactRollback [ArtifactRollback_Leave]
14. [ArtifactRollbackReboot_Enter] ArtifactRollbackReboot
15. (device reboot)
16. [ArtifactRollbackReboot_Leave]
17. [Idle_Enter] Idle [Idle_Leave]

Please note that similar to the `ArtifactReboot` state, scripts in the `ArtifactRollbackReboot_Leave` transition are called after the device has rebooted.
