!!!!! It is required to have the _Mender Monitor_ add-on enabled in your account.
!!!!! See [the Mender features page](https://mender.io/product/features?target=_blank)
!!!!! for an overview of all Mender plans and features.

The Mender Monitor add-on gives you instant visibility into issues
within your device fleet. In addition, it allows you to customize the conditions
to detect when certain parts of your infrastructure malfunction or need your attention.

To conserve bandwidth and facilitate edge processing, Mender Monitor optimizes
data transmission by only sending data when specific conditions are met,
ensuring efficient data utilization.
Compared to classic approaches of sending all the data about all the nodes
to the server all the time, which leads to massive bandwidth savings and
allows instant local processing.
