File Transfer is a [mender-connect](../../90.Mender-Connect/docs.md#Installation) based add-on.
This means that to get it working you do not need any special installation steps.
The main requirements are: `mender-client` and `mender-connect`; please refer
to the below sections for the details:
* [mender-convert integration](../../../04.System-updates-Debian-family/99.Variables/docs.md#mender_addon_connect_install) for installation in the existing images
* [Yocto projects](../../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project/05.Customize-Mender/docs.md#mender-connect) for the installation in a Yocto Project environment
* [installation with a deb](../../../10.Downloads/docs.md#remote-terminal-add-on) for the installation from the Debian package

Please consult the [configuration section](../../90.Mender-Connect/docs.md#configuration) 
for the available configuration options.
