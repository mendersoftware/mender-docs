Please refer to the following sections for the Remote Terminal add-on installation:
* [mender-convert integration](../../../04.System-updates-Debian-family/99.Variables/docs.md#mender_addon_connect_install) for installation in the existing images
* [Yocto projects](../../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project/05.Customize-Mender/docs.md#mender-connect) for the installation in a Yocto Project environment
* [installation with a deb](../../../09.Downloads/docs.md#Remote-Terminal-add-on) for the installation from the Debian package

Apart from [configuration](../30.Mender-connect-configuration-file/docs.md), you do not need any other special steps
to get the Remote Terminal add-on up and running. Please note, that you have to enable DBus
in the Mender client to be able to run commands on the devices from the Mender UI.
