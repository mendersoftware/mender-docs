Quickly and easily deploy your first over-the-air (OTA) software update with
Mender using a secure server we host for you. We will walk you through
installing Mender on a device and deploying:

* a simple *application* update
* a full *system* update.
* a *Docker container* update

To get started testing Mender, create a hosted Mender account by
[signing up here](https://mender.io/signup?target=_blank).

!!! We provide a 12 month free evaluation period of the Mender Enterprise plan
!!! for up to 10 devices. No credit card is required to signup.

## Next steps

With an hosted Mender account in place, it is time to prepare a device to
connect to hosted Mender.

You can connect almost any device and Linux OS with Mender, but to make things simple 
during evaluation we recommend you use a Raspberry Pi as a test device.
You can learn how to integrate other devices and OSes later.


* [To prepare a Raspberry Pi device](01.Prepare-a-Raspberry-Pi-device/docs.md) (**recommended**)

  Due to the popularity of Raspberry Pi devices our reference environment is
  optimized for evaluation on this specific device using Raspberry Pi OS
  (previously called Raspbian) as operating system. This environment should
  already be familiar to most people.

* [To prepare a virtual device](02.Prepare-a-virtual-device/docs.md)

  If you do not have a Raspberry Pi available, you can use a virtual device to
  evaluate key Mender use cases.

  This tutorial provides the steps for preparing your workstation to be able to run
  a virtual ([QEMU process emulator](https://www.qemu.org/?target=_blank)) device with Mender
  integrated.


### Connecting other devices

For other device types and OSes, we provide documentation to integrate with Mender.

* Learn how to integrate devices with [Debian family](../../04.System-updates-Debian-family) or 
  [Yocto OSes](../../05.System-updates-Yocto-Project)
* Or visit [Board Integrations](https://hub.mender.io/c/board-integrations?target=_blank) on 
  Mender Hub and search for your device and OS.

!!! We recommend running through the Get Started guide with a Raspberry Pi or virtual device to 
!!! learn the basics before diving into other board integrations.
